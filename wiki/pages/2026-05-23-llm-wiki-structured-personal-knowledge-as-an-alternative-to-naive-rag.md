## Overview

This lesson explains the idea of an "LLM wiki": a curated, structured knowledge file or small collection of files designed to be read directly by a large language model. The core claim is that for many personal, team, or project-specific workflows, a hand-maintained wiki can outperform naive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines because it provides cleaner context, clearer organization, and less retrieval noise.

Engineers who are experimenting with AI assistants for software projects, research notes, internal docs, or personal knowledge bases should care because this approach is often simpler to build and maintain than a full vector database stack. It trades automation for quality: instead of chunking and embedding everything, you deliberately shape information into a form that models can consume reliably.

## Key Concepts

- **LLM-native documentation**: LLM-native documentation is information written primarily for machine consumption by language models, while still remaining readable to humans. It emphasizes explicit structure, concise facts, stable terminology, and predictable formatting over prose optimized only for human browsing.
- **Naive RAG limitations**: Naive RAG typically ingests a corpus, splits it into chunks, embeds those chunks, and retrieves the top matches for a query. This often fails when relevant context is spread across multiple chunks, when ranking is imprecise, or when the retrieved text lacks the framing needed for the model to reason correctly.
- **Curated context**: Curated context means intentionally selecting and organizing the knowledge that the model should use, rather than relying fully on automated retrieval. This can improve answer quality because the model receives higher-signal, lower-ambiguity input.
- **Hierarchical knowledge organization**: A wiki-style knowledge base usually works best when it is hierarchical: top-level summaries point to sections, and sections point to details. This allows both humans and models to navigate from broad concepts to precise facts without being overwhelmed by raw source material.
- **Context window economics**: Modern LLMs can consume large amounts of text, but context is still limited and expensive. A well-structured wiki uses that context budget efficiently by compressing important knowledge into summaries, canonical definitions, and compact reference sections.
- **Human-in-the-loop knowledge maintenance**: Unlike fully automated RAG pipelines, an LLM wiki depends on deliberate editing and upkeep. The payoff is that corrections, canonical terminology, and project-specific conventions can be encoded directly, reducing recurring model errors.

## How It Works

The central idea is simple: instead of treating your documents as a raw corpus to be automatically chunked and retrieved, you create a structured "idea file" or wiki that acts as the authoritative source of context for the model. The wiki contains the facts, decisions, definitions, and relationships that matter most. In practice, this can be a single markdown file for a small project or a small tree of markdown files for a larger one.

A typical LLM wiki has a few properties:

- **Canonical terminology**: one preferred name per concept
- **Compact summaries**: short overviews before detailed sections
- **Explicit relationships**: links such as "depends on," "contrasts with," or "used by"
- **High-signal content**: distilled facts, not every raw note or log entry
- **Stable structure**: headings and sections that are easy for prompts or tools to reference

This differs from standard RAG in an important way. RAG assumes the source corpus is mostly fine as-is and that retrieval can assemble the right context on demand. The LLM wiki approach assumes the corpus is often noisy, redundant, or badly structured for model consumption. So instead of optimizing the retriever first, you optimize the knowledge representation.

A practical workflow looks like this:

1. **Collect source material**
   - docs
   - issue discussions
   - architecture decisions
   - personal notes
   - recurring questions and answers

2. **Distill the material into a wiki**
   - create a top-level overview
   - define core entities and concepts
   - document conventions and invariants
   - add short examples
   - remove stale or duplicate statements

3. **Use the wiki as prompt context**
   - provide the whole file if it fits
   - or provide the table of contents plus selected sections
   - ask the model to cite section names when answering

4. **Update based on failures**
   - when the model makes a mistake, fix the wiki
   - when users ask repeated questions, add a concise entry
   - when terminology drifts, normalize it in one place

The reason this can "replace RAG" in some cases is not that retrieval is useless, but that many real-world uses do not need a sophisticated retrieval stack. If your important knowledge can fit into a reasonably small, well-organized document set, direct inclusion is often more robust than semantic search over uncurated data. This is especially true for:

- project onboarding
- coding assistants bound to one codebase
- research agendas
- personal knowledge systems
- internal team playbooks

A useful mental model is:

```text
Raw documents -> Distillation -> Structured wiki -> Prompt context -> Better answers
```

Instead of:

```text
Raw documents -> Chunking -> Embeddings -> Retrieval -> Maybe relevant context -> Answer
```

That said, the best systems are often hybrid. A wiki can hold the high-value, stable, canonical knowledge, while RAG is used for long-tail details or raw source lookup. In that architecture, the wiki becomes the model's trusted orientation layer, and retrieval supplies supporting evidence when necessary.

When designing such a wiki, engineers should focus on the following content structure:

- **Overview**: what this project or domain is about
- **Glossary**: exact meanings of terms
- **Core facts/invariants**: what must always be true
- **Architecture or mental model**: how parts fit together
- **Common tasks**: step-by-step operational guidance
- **Pitfalls**: known failure modes and anti-patterns
- **Open questions**: areas where the knowledge is incomplete

The biggest tradeoff is maintenance cost. A wiki only works if someone keeps it current. But that cost can be lower than maintaining a brittle ingestion and retrieval pipeline, especially when the domain is narrow and quality matters more than breadth. For many engineers, the insight is that better answers do not always require more infrastructure; sometimes they require better source organization.

## Training Exercise

Build a small LLM wiki for a project you know well and compare it against a naive RAG-style document dump.

### Goal
Evaluate whether a curated wiki gives better answers than raw documentation pasted into a model.

### Step 1: Pick a domain
Choose one of the following:

- a software repository you work on
- a service runbook
- a personal research topic
- a team onboarding guide

### Step 2: Create a wiki file
Make a file called `llm_wiki.md` with this structure:

```md
# Project Wiki

## Overview
What this project does, who uses it, and the main components.

## Glossary
- Term A: definition
- Term B: definition

## Core Invariants
- Invariant 1
- Invariant 2

## Architecture
Describe how the major parts interact.

## Common Tasks
### Task: Add a new endpoint
1. ...
2. ...

## Pitfalls
- Common mistake 1
- Common mistake 2

## Open Questions
- Question 1
```

Fill it with 1-3 pages of dense, high-signal content.

### Step 3: Prepare a raw corpus version
Create a second file called `raw_notes.md` by copying in assorted source material without much cleanup:

- meeting notes
- README excerpts
- issue comments
- design notes
- troubleshooting snippets

Keep it roughly similar in total length to the wiki.

### Step 4: Test both with the same questions
Ask an LLM the same 5 questions twice:

1. once with `llm_wiki.md`
2. once with `raw_notes.md`

Suggested questions:

- What are the most important concepts in this project?
- How would a new engineer safely make a change?
- What assumptions must never be violated?
- What terminology is easy to confuse?
- What are the likely failure modes?

### Step 5: Score the outputs
For each answer, score 1-5 on:

- correctness
- specificity
- completeness
- consistency of terminology
- usefulness for action

### Step 6: Improve the wiki
Based on failures, revise the wiki by adding:

- clearer definitions
- missing invariants
- better examples
- explicit relationships between concepts

### Optional extension
Try a hybrid prompt:

```text
Use the wiki as the primary source of truth. Use the raw notes only for supporting details or examples. If there is a conflict, prefer the wiki and mention the conflict.
```

Then compare whether the hybrid approach outperforms either source alone.
