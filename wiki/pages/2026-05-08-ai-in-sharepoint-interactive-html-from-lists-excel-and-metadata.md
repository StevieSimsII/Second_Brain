## Overview

These notes describe a SharePoint AI capability that can transform structured content already stored in SharePoint—such as lists, document libraries, Excel files, and even site metadata—into interactive HTML experiences without hand-coding. The examples include dashboards, org charts, conference schedules, restaurant menus, pricing pages, site maps, and usage-style reports generated from natural-language prompts and optionally standardized using reusable "skills."

This matters because it positions SharePoint as more than a content repository: it becomes a lightweight application-generation surface. For Microsoft 365 engineers, architects, and power users, the key implication is that existing business data models can be turned into fit-for-purpose interfaces directly where the data already lives, potentially reducing the need for custom SPFx web parts, external apps, or manual report-building workflows.

## Key Concepts

- **Prompt-driven HTML generation**: AI can interpret a natural-language request and produce a complete HTML experience from SharePoint-hosted data.
- **Structured data as application input**: Lists and Excel files provide schema and records that help the AI infer useful UI patterns.
- **Skills as reusable templates**: Skills act as repeatable formatting and instruction layers for branding, layout, and output consistency.
- **Interactive reporting over static exports**: The generated result behaves more like a mini web app than a static document.
- **Metadata-driven site analysis**: SharePoint site structure itself can be analyzed and turned into explorable outputs.
- **No-code generation with technical implications**: Even if the user experience is no-code, the output still raises questions about HTML/CSS/JS execution, permissions, and governance.

## How It Works

At a high level, the workflow in the notes is:

1. Select a SharePoint data source such as a list, Excel file, or site metadata.
2. Provide a natural-language prompt describing the desired experience.
3. Let SharePoint AI interpret both the prompt and the source schema.
4. Generate an HTML artifact, potentially including JavaScript and CSS.
5. Open the result as an interactive experience.
6. Optionally apply reusable skills to enforce branding and formatting conventions.

A useful mental model is:

```text
SharePoint data source -> schema + records inferred by AI -> prompt intent interpreted -> UI pattern selected -> HTML/CSS/JS generated -> saved as interactive output
```

The examples in the notes show how different data shapes map to different UI patterns:

- A SharePoint list can become a dashboard.
- An Excel employee file can become a searchable org chart.
- Event-style records can become an interactive conference schedule.
- Product or menu data can become a browsable catalog.
- Plan/package data can become a pricing comparison page.
- SharePoint lists, libraries, columns, and views can become a site map or usage-style metadata report.

The most reusable idea here is the separation of concerns:

- **Content/data input**: the list, spreadsheet, or metadata source
- **Prompt intent**: the type of experience to generate
- **Presentation policy**: branding and layout rules captured as skills

That separation suggests a practical operating model: define strong skills once, then reuse them across multiple sources to get more consistent outputs.

There are also important engineering questions to validate before production use:

- **Static vs live data**: confirm whether generated HTML is a snapshot or remains connected to source data.
- **Permission model**: ensure generated outputs do not broaden visibility beyond intended access boundaries.
- **Custom code governance**: verify how generated HTML/JS/CSS is hosted and whether tenant settings restrict it.
- **Repeatability and drift**: use stronger prompts and skills when you need consistent artifacts across runs.
- **Schema resilience**: expect issues if columns are renamed, records are inconsistent, or data quality is weak.

The notes also include a practical training exercise: choose a real or mock SharePoint dataset, define a target UI, write a generation prompt, define a reusable skill, map fields to UI elements, and document production concerns. This is a useful way to test whether the AI feature can be applied reliably in a real tenant and whether a proposed template is truly reusable across different datasets.

Overview

This lesson explains a new SharePoint AI capability demonstrated in a LinkedIn post: turning structured content already stored in SharePoint—lists, document libraries, and Excel files—into interactive HTML experiences without hand-coding. The examples include dashboards, org charts, restaurant menus, conference schedules, pricing pages, site maps, and usage reports, all generated from prompts and optionally standardized with reusable "skills."

For engineers, architects, and power users working in Microsoft 365, this matters because it shifts SharePoint from being just a repository for business data into a lightweight application-generation surface. Instead of building custom SPFx parts or external web apps for every reporting need, teams can use AI to synthesize HTML, JavaScript, and CSS directly from existing content models and metadata, then apply reusable templates for consistency and governance.

Key Concepts

  *   Prompt-driven HTML generation: The central capability is that AI can read SharePoint-hosted data and generate a complete HTML experience from a natural-language prompt. The generated output may include structure, styling, and client-side interactivity such as filtering, expansion panels, search, and live widgets.
  *   Structured data as application input: SharePoint lists and Excel spreadsheets provide the underlying schema and records that the AI transforms into visual experiences. Because the data is already organized into columns and rows, it is easier for the model to infer relationships like hierarchies, categories, dates, pricing tiers, or inventory summaries.
  *   Skills as reusable templates: Skills are described as reusable instructions or templates that enforce branding, layout, and output style across multiple generated artifacts. Instead of re-specifying colors, formatting, and report structure each time, a skill lets you ask once and reuse the pattern across future generations.
  *   Interactive reporting over static exports: The generated outputs are not simple snapshots or PDFs; they are interactive HTML artifacts. Examples in the source include filters, expandable details, scrolling headers, clickable navigation, and searchable site inventories, which makes the generated report behave more like a mini web app.
  *   Metadata-driven site analysis: The demo extends beyond business records to SharePoint metadata itself, generating site maps and usage-style reports from lists, libraries, columns, and views. This shows that AI can operate on the platform's information architecture, not just end-user content.
  *   No-code generation with technical implications: Although the experience is presented as no-code, the system is still producing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript under the hood. Engineers should think about output safety, data freshness, access permissions, custom script restrictions, and whether generated pages are static renderings or connected to live data sources.

How It Works

At a high level, the workflow demonstrated in the source looks like this:

1. A user selects or references content already available in SharePoint, such as: - a SharePoint list - an Excel file stored in a document library - a site's lists, libraries, columns, and views 2. The user provides a natural-language prompt describing the desired experience. 3. SharePoint AI interprets both the prompt and the underlying data shape. 4. The system generates an HTML artifact, including JavaScript and CSS where needed. 5. The generated file is opened and used as an interactive experience. 6. Optional reusable "skills" apply branding, formatting, and report conventions so output is consistent across runs.

The source shows several categories of generated experiences, each illustrating a different kind of data interpretation:

- **Dashboard from list data**: AI reads rows in a SharePoint list and creates a richer visual summary than the default list view. - **Org chart from Excel**: AI infers reporting relationships from spreadsheet fields and renders a filterable org chart with search. - **Conference schedule**: AI uses event-like records to build an agenda UI with expandable session details and sticky headers. - **Restaurant menu**: AI maps category and attribute fields into a browsable menu with filters. - **Pricing page**: AI reformats plan or package data into a marketing-style comparison view. - **Site map / usage report**: AI inventories the SharePoint site's own structure and produces an explorable metadata report.

A useful way to reason about the mechanics is as a transformation pipeline:

```text SharePoint data source -> schema + records inferred by AI -> prompt intent interpreted -> UI pattern selected -> HTML/CSS/JS generated -> saved as interactive output ```

The role of **skills** is especially important. In the demo, a color-palette skill and a site-map skill are used to shape the output. That implies a separation between:

- **content/data input**: the list, spreadsheet, or site metadata - **presentation policy**: branding, layout rules, formatting conventions - **prompt intent**: what kind of experience to build

That separation
