## Overview

This lesson explains the shift of Microsoft 365 Copilot Cowork from preview-era "included inference" to a generally available, consumption-based service billed through Copilot Credits. For engineers, platform owners, and M365 administrators, the important change is that agentic AI usage is no longer just a licensing question; it becomes an operational cost-management problem tied to how tasks are executed.

The source emphasizes that cost depends on the full execution lifecycle of a task, not just the model invocation. That means technical design choices—model selection, retrieval scope, tool actions, and orchestration runtime—directly affect spend. Understanding these levers is essential for building internal governance, reporting, and budget controls before usage starts appearing on invoices.

## Key Concepts

- **Copilot Credits**: Copilot Cowork usage is billed in Copilot Credits rather than being fully bundled into the base experience. The post states PayGo pricing at $0.01 per credit, making credits the unit that connects technical activity to financial cost.
- **License plus consumption model**: Users first need a Microsoft 365 Copilot User Subscription License, and then task execution incurs additional consumption charges. This creates a two-layer cost structure: entitlement through licensing and variable usage through credits.
- **Execution lifecycle billing**: Consumption is measured across the full lifecycle of a task, not just a single prompt-response interaction. That includes model inference, retrieval and grounding, tool invocations, and long-running orchestration.
- **Four cost dimensions**: The source identifies Models, Context, Tools, and Runtime as the main dimensions that drive credit use. Together they describe AI quality choices, retrieval breadth, downstream actions, and agent orchestration complexity.
- **Runtime-dominant agentic cost**: As tasks become more autonomous and multi-step, orchestration runtime can become the primary cost driver rather than the model itself. This is a key architectural insight for anyone designing or approving agent workflows.
- **FinOps for M365 AI**: The post frames governance as a FinOps-style discipline for Microsoft 365 AI. Instead of only asking how many seats to buy, organizations need controls, reporting, budgets, and policies that tie usage to business value.

## How It Works

Copilot Cowork is presented here as a metered agentic service layered on top of Microsoft 365 Copilot licensing. The economic model works in two stages:

1. A user must have a **Microsoft 365 Copilot User Subscription License**.
2. Actual Cowork activity is then billed through **Copilot Credits**.

This means availability and billing are decoupled. A user can be licensed to use the service, but the organization still needs to manage whether, where, and how much consumption is allowed.

The post describes two billing approaches:

- **PayGo** for flexible usage
- **P3** for committing to usage volume in advance in exchange for a discount

In practical terms, this is similar to cloud consumption planning. PayGo is useful for pilots, experimentation, and uncertain demand. A committed model like P3 is more suitable when usage patterns are predictable enough to justify pre-purchased capacity.

The central technical idea is that a Cowork task is not priced as a single LLM call. It is priced across the **entire execution lifecycle**. The source identifies four dimensions:

- **Models**: more capable or lower-latency models can change cost
- **Context**: retrieving and grounding from email, meetings, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, CRM, business apps, and interaction history expands the work done per task
- **Tools**: every action the agent performs, such as creating files, sending emails, updating records, or running workflows, adds additional usage
- **Runtime**: the orchestration layer that plans and coordinates long-running, multi-step work

A useful way to think about this is as a pipeline:

```text
User request
  -> planner/orchestrator decides steps
  -> model selected for reasoning/generation
  -> context retrieved from M365 and business systems
  -> tools invoked to act on behalf of the user
  -> runtime tracks and coordinates the workflow until completion
```

The source makes an important architectural point: **runtime is the dimension to watch**. In simple tasks, model inference may dominate. But in autonomous or semi-autonomous workflows—research synthesis, cross-system reviews, or multi-step planning—the cost shifts toward orchestration and coordination. In other words, once an AI system starts behaving like an agent, "how long and how broadly it works" matters as much as "which model it used."

The post also gives rough task bands in credits:

- **Light tasks: 100-300 credits**
  - Examples: status summaries, short reports, simple content
- **Medium tasks: 400-700 credits**
  - Examples: meeting prep, executive briefings, presentation generation, opportunity analysis
- **Heavy tasks: 700+ credits**
  - Examples: large research synthesis, multi-month analysis, cross-system reviews, planning work

At $0.01 per credit, those ranges roughly translate to:

- Light: **$1-$3**
- Medium: **$4-$7**
- Heavy: **$7+**

This is why the post says the discussion becomes financial, not just technical. A workflow that feels harmless at a single-user level can become material spend at enterprise scale.

Governance is the operational response. The source mentions the following control surfaces:

- Cowork **disabled by default**
- **Tenant-, group-, and user-level access** controls
- **Budgets** and **scoped billing policies**
- **Credit request workflows**
- **Tenant-, group-, and user-level reporting**
- **Feature- and task-level usage insights**
- **User-level pricing per task** after GA

That governance model resembles cloud FinOps and can be mapped into an engineering operating model:

- **Access management** limits who can trigger potentially expensive workflows.
- **Billing policies** separate experimentation from production use.
- **Budgets and caps** prevent accidental runaway consumption.
- **Reporting** provides the telemetry needed to identify which task types, users, or teams are driving spend.
- **Value review** ties cost to outcomes such as hours saved, quality improved, or process throughput increased.

The main reasoning flow of the article is therefore:

1. Cowork is GA and no longer effectively free under preview assumptions.
2. Consumption is now explicit and metered through credits.
3. Technical implementation choices affect cost across four dimensions.
4. Runtime-heavy agentic workflows are likely to surprise teams on spend.
5. Organizations need governance and reporting before invoices arrive.

For a working engineer, the practical takeaway is to design AI workflows with cost-aware architecture. Narrow retrieval scope where possible, avoid unnecessary tool chaining, reserve deep orchestration for high-value workflows, and make cost observability part of rollout from day one.

## Training Exercise

Build a simple **Copilot Cowork cost-estimation worksheet** for three internal use cases and use it to propose governance controls.

### Goal
Practice translating AI workflow design into estimated Copilot Credit consumption and policy decisions.

### Step 1: Pick three tasks
Choose one task from each category:

- Light: weekly status summary
- Medium: meeting prep with document retrieval
- Heavy: cross-system quarterly business review

### Step 2: Create a scoring table
Use a spreadsheet or a small JSON/YAML file with these columns:

- Task name
- Model complexity: low / medium / high
- Context scope: narrow / moderate / broad
- Tool actions: few / several / many
- Runtime complexity: short / multi-step / long-running
- Estimated credits
- Estimated dollar cost
- Business value

Example starter table:

```csv
task,model,context,tools,runtime,estimated_credits,estimated_cost_usd,business_value
weekly_status_summary,low,narrow,few,short,150,1.50,team visibility
meeting_prep_brief,medium,moderate,several,multi-step,550,5.50,exec readiness
quarterly_cross_system_review,high,broad,many,long-running,900,9.00,strategic planning
```

### Step 3: Estimate using the source ranges
Apply the source guidance:

- Light: 100-300 credits
- Medium: 400-700 credits
- Heavy: 700+ credits

You are not trying to get exact numbers; you are practicing reasoned classification based on the four dimensions.

### Step 4: Identify the dominant cost driver
For each task, write one sentence answering:

- Is the main cost from model quality, retrieval breadth, tool invocations, or runtime orchestration?

Example:

- "Meeting prep is mostly driven by context because it searches across meetings, email, and documents."
- "Quarterly review is mostly driven by runtime because it requires long-running multi-step orchestration across systems."

### Step 5: Propose governance rules
Define one control for each task type:

- Light tasks: enabled for all licensed users
- Medium tasks: enabled for a pilot group with monthly budget caps
- Heavy tasks: require approval or a dedicated billing policy

### Step 6: Write an engineering recommendation
Draft a short recommendation for IT or platform leadership covering:

1. Which tasks should be broadly enabled first
2. Which tasks need budget controls
3. What reports you need before scaling usage

### Optional automation step
If you want to make it more concrete, write a tiny script to convert credits into dollars:

```python
def cost_usd(credits, price_per_credit=0.01):
    return round(credits * price_per_credit, 2)

for credits in [150, 550, 900]:
    print(credits, cost_usd(credits))
```

Expected outcome: you should end with a small cost model and a governance proposal that demonstrates you understand how technical task design maps to financial exposure.
