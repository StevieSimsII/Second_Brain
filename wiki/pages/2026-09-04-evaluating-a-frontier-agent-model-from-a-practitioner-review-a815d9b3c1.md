## Overview

This lesson turns a single reviewer’s long-form account of using "GPT6 Astra" into a reusable framework for evaluating advanced AI models in real work. The source is strong on firsthand usage details and concrete examples, but thin on independently verified evidence, so treat pricing, rollout, benchmark, and safety claims as reported claims from the transcript rather than settled fact. The durable takeaway is not "this model wins," but how to judge any frontier model by cost per completed task, tool-use reliability, scope control, long-session behavior, and the point at which you trust it enough to delegate meaningful work.

## Key Concepts

- **Reported claims vs. verified facts**: The transcript mixes firsthand experience, vendor benchmark summaries, and speculation about rollout constraints. A durable knowledge base should label each type clearly. For example, the reviewer directly observed coding, computer-use, and 3D tasks, but pricing tables, benchmark scores, and availability details are still secondhand unless you verify them elsewhere.
- **Cost per task matters more than token price**: The reviewer argues that raw input/output token pricing does not tell the full story. A model can be expensive per token yet cheaper per finished task if it is more efficient, requires fewer retries, or can complete longer end-to-end workflows without supervision. This is a practical way to compare models used as agents rather than as chatbots.
- **Agentic capability is broader than code generation**: The source treats the model’s value as coming from computer use, long-running workflows, self-prompting, and multi-step coordination, not just writing code. The practical lesson is to evaluate models on the full work loop: planning, asking clarifying questions, using tools, monitoring results, and cleaning up after changes.
- **Trust depends on scope discipline**: A major positive claim in the transcript is that the model makes smaller, better-scoped changes than earlier models. That matters because useful agents do not just solve problems; they avoid creating oversized PRs, unnecessary tests, or side effects that raise review cost. Scope control is a key trust signal.
- **Long-context performance includes compaction behavior**: The reviewer emphasizes not only a large context window, but the model’s ability to stay oriented as tasks evolve and to retain useful state after compaction. For durable evaluation, test whether the model can continue a long task without losing constraints, goals, or lessons learned earlier in the session.
- **Strong capability can coexist with frustrating failure modes**: The source gives examples where the model identifies valid review feedback yet fails to act, stops monitoring too early, or gets stuck in loops. This is a crucial operational lesson: a highly capable model may still need guardrails for follow-through, verification, and termination conditions.

## How It Works

Use this framework when assessing an advanced model for real work. First, separate evidence into three buckets: direct observation, reported benchmark/vendor claim, and speculation. Second, test the model on complete workflows rather than isolated prompts: code changes, tool use, document or spreadsheet manipulation, UI work, and long-running tasks. Third, score outcomes on practical dimensions the transcript highlights: cost per finished task, speed, ability to ask focused questions without blocking, scope discipline, quality of cleanup, and reliability under review feedback. Fourth, probe edge cases deliberately: long sessions, conflicting instructions, monitoring responsibilities, and tasks where aesthetics or human taste matter, such as frontend design or video editing. Finally, define your trust threshold explicitly. The reviewer’s closing question is the durable one: at what bar do you stop checking every step and start delegating? In practice, that bar should be task-specific, backed by repeatable tests, and lowered only where failures are cheap and reversible.

## Training Exercise

Pick one model you already use and run a three-part evaluation. 1. Give it a bounded code task with a clear definition of done and note whether it stays within scope. 2. Give it a tool-using task that requires navigation or external state, then measure time-to-completion and how often it needs correction. 3. Give it a long task with midstream steering and at least one review cycle, then check whether it preserves context, addresses feedback without prompting, and stops only when the work is actually complete. Write a short scorecard with columns for direct evidence, reported claims, failure modes, and whether you would trust the model to run that task with light supervision, heavy supervision, or no delegation.
