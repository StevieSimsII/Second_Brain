## Overview

Utopia is presented as an open-source "enterprise world model" that combines a bitemporal knowledge graph, ontology governance, search, chat, and auditability in a single self-hosted system. From the supplied repository structure, it is a Rust workspace with multiple domain crates, a Postgres-backed storage layer, SQL migrations, bundled ontology packs, and a separate web frontend. The practical lesson is that Utopia is not just a vector search app: it treats time, ontology, review, and decision traceability as first-class parts of the knowledge system.

## Key Concepts

- **Bitemporal knowledge graph**: Utopia records both when a fact was true in the world and when the system believed it. Corrections do not overwrite prior facts; they close old versions and link replacements, preserving reviewable history.
- **Ontology as a control layer**: The ontology is not decorative metadata. It shapes extraction, querying, reasoning, and conflict handling. The repo also ships ontology packs such as schema.org, W3C Org, PROV-O, FOAF, and IOF Core for cold-start vocabulary.
- **Minimal runtime footprint**: The README claims the deployed system is one Rust binary plus one Postgres instance. Full-text search is embedded, vectors are stored in pgvector, and the job queue is implemented as database tables rather than separate infrastructure.
- **Ingest to graph pipeline**: The system ingests documents and external sources, extracts entities and facts, resolves duplicates, and stores provenance-aware graph data. The file tree supports this flow with crates like `utopia-ingest`, `utopia-extract`, `utopia-store`, and server modules such as `extraction.rs`, `ingest_sources.rs`, and `pipeline.rs`.
- **Hybrid retrieval and chat**: Search uses full-text plus vector retrieval fused with reciprocal rank fusion (RRF), then exposes answers with inline citations. The source states that OpenAI-compatible model endpoints can be configured, which implies model choice is external to the core system.
- **Reasoning, review, and audit**: Ontology axioms can derive new facts, but derivation is optional because bad axioms can amplify errors. The system also includes review queues, conflict detection, reversible merges, and an append-only decision ledger, showing a strong bias toward governed rather than fully automatic knowledge updates.

## How It Works

At a repository level, Utopia is organized as a Rust monorepo around distinct responsibilities. `crates/utopia-server` appears to host the application entrypoint, API routes, live/chat behavior, source connectors, ontology bootstrapping, and retrieval logic. `crates/utopia-store` concentrates persistence concerns such as accounts, documents, graph storage, ontology, reasoning state, review, tokens, and temporal behavior, backed by the SQL migrations in `migrations/0001_core.sql` through `0021_lakehouse_engines.sql`. `crates/utopia-ingest` and `crates/utopia-extract` handle parsing and chunking inputs, while `crates/utopia-reason` contains derivation and ontology logic, and `crates/utopia-search` covers document search. On the frontend side, `web/` is a separate app with pages for chat, graph browsing, ontology editing, review, settings, mappings, and document viewing. Operationally, the intended flow is: ingest sources or files, parse and extract candidate facts, align them to an ontology, resolve entities, store facts with provenance and time information, optionally derive additional facts from axioms, surface uncertain or conflicting cases for review, and make the resulting corpus available through search, graph exploration, and chat. The evidence for product scope is strong in the README and file tree, but some runtime details remain inferred from filenames rather than demonstrated code paths.

## Training Exercise

Trace one end-to-end learning path through the repo. First, read the README sections on Features and Quick start and write a one-sentence definition of "world model" in Utopia's terms. Next, map the likely lifecycle of a PDF upload using only observed files: start with `crates/utopia-ingest/src/parsers.rs` and `chunker.rs`, continue to `crates/utopia-server/src/extraction.rs` and `pipeline.rs`, then inspect `crates/utopia-store/src/documents.rs`, `graph.rs`, `temporal.rs`, `review.rs`, and `audit.rs`. After that, explain where each of these concerns lives: provenance, temporal validity, conflict review, entity resolution, and search. Finish by checking the UI pages in `web/src/pages/` and identify which screens would let an operator verify or correct the extracted knowledge. Your deliverable is a short architecture note with three sections: ingest, governance, and retrieval.
