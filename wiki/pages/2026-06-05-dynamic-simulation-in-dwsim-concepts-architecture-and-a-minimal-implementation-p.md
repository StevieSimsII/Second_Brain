## Overview

The provided source page is unavailable, so the lesson below reconstructs the likely subject matter from the article title: how dynamic simulation can be built in DWSIM. Dynamic simulation extends steady-state process simulation by tracking how process variables evolve over time, which is essential for startup/shutdown studies, controller design, disturbance analysis, and operator training.

This matters to engineers working with chemical process models, especially those using DWSIM or similar simulators and wanting to understand what must change in the code and model structure to support time-dependent behavior. The core challenge is turning algebraic unit-operation calculations into coupled differential-algebraic system updates while preserving thermodynamic consistency, convergence, and usability.

## Key Concepts

- **Steady-state vs dynamic simulation**: A steady-state simulator solves for process variables assuming no accumulation with respect to time. A dynamic simulator adds material, energy, and momentum accumulation terms so state variables such as holdup, temperature, pressure, and composition evolve over time. This changes both the mathematical formulation and the software architecture.
- **State variables and holdup**: Dynamic simulation requires each unit operation to define internal states, usually related to mass and energy stored in equipment. Examples include liquid level in a vessel, component moles in a separator, or internal energy in a tank. Without explicit holdup, there is nothing to integrate over time.
- **Differential-algebraic equations**: Most process models are naturally expressed as differential-algebraic equations, or DAEs. Differential equations describe time evolution of accumulated quantities, while algebraic equations enforce thermodynamic equilibrium, pressure-flow relations, and constitutive constraints. The simulation engine must consistently solve both parts at every time step.
- **Time stepping and numerical integration**: Dynamic models advance from one time point to the next using an integration method such as explicit Euler, implicit Euler, or higher-order ODE/DAE solvers. The integrator takes current states, computes derivatives, and updates the model. Stability, accuracy, and robustness depend heavily on the chosen scheme and step size.
- **Reusing thermodynamics in dynamics**: A dynamic simulator should not duplicate thermodynamic logic. Instead, it should reuse the same property packages used by steady-state calculations to compute enthalpy, phase equilibrium, densities, and derivatives. This keeps behavior consistent across static and dynamic modes.
- **Event handling and control**: Real dynamic simulations often include discontinuities such as valve opening changes, pump trips, controller mode switches, and setpoint updates. The framework must support event scheduling and recalculation of affected units. Controls are especially important because many realistic processes are unstable without feedback.

## How It Works

Because the source article content is not available, the most useful way to approach the topic is to explain the mechanics of adding dynamic simulation to a process simulator like DWSIM.

A typical steady-state process simulator is organized around a flowsheet graph:

- **Material streams** carry temperature, pressure, flow, composition, and enthalpy.
- **Energy streams** carry heat duties or shaft work.
- **Unit operations** transform inlet streams into outlet streams using mass/energy balances and equipment models.
- **Property packages** compute thermodynamic and transport properties.
- **A flowsheet solver** sequences or iterates the units until algebraic convergence is achieved.

To support **dynamic simulation**, this architecture must be extended so units can retain internal state and expose time derivatives. In practice, each dynamic-capable unit operation needs additional responsibilities:

1. **Declare state variables**
   - Total holdup or phase holdup
   - Component inventories
   - Internal energy or enthalpy inventory
   - Pressure or level, if modeled dynamically

2. **Compute derivatives** from balance equations
   - Material balance: accumulation = in - out + generation
   - Energy balance: energy accumulation = inlet energy - outlet energy + heat/work
   - Momentum or pressure relations where needed

3. **Update outlet conditions** based on current state
   - For a tank, outlet composition comes from current vessel composition
   - For a flash drum, phase split depends on current pressure, temperature, and composition
   - For controlled equipment, manipulated variables may change with controller output

4. **Interact with the integrator**
   - The simulator collects all states into a global state vector
   - The integrator advances the vector in time
   - After each step, algebraic variables and stream properties are recalculated

A common data flow for one simulation time step looks like this:

1. Read current global state vector.
2. Push the relevant subset into each unit operation.
3. Recompute thermodynamic properties using the active property package.
4. Evaluate algebraic relations such as phase equilibrium, valve equations, and pressure-flow equations.
5. Compute time derivatives for each unit's states.
6. Use the integration scheme to calculate the next state vector.
7. Propagate updated outlet stream values through the flowsheet.
8. Process scheduled events and control actions.
9. Store results for plotting or reporting.

In a DWSIM-like codebase, even without the exact article, you would expect dynamic functionality to be split across a few logical areas:

- **Flowsheet model layer**: stores simulation objects and connectivity.
- **Stream classes**: hold thermodynamic state and flow information.
- **Unit operation classes**: contain both steady-state solve logic and, for dynamic units, state/derivative methods.
- **Property package layer**: performs flash calculations and property evaluation.
- **Solver/integration engine**: manages time stepping and convergence.
- **UI or orchestration layer**: starts, pauses, and visualizes transient runs.

A practical implementation pattern is to add methods such as:

```text
GetDynamicStates()
SetDynamicStates(x)
CalculateDerivatives(t)
UpdateOutputs()
```

At the flowsheet level, the engine can aggregate all unit states:

```text
x = concat(unit.GetDynamicStates() for unit in dynamic_units)
dxdt = concat(unit.CalculateDerivatives(t) for unit in dynamic_units)
```

Then a simple integrator advances time:

```text
x_next = x + dt * dxdt
```

This is explicit Euler, which is easy to implement but may be unstable for stiff process systems. In production dynamic simulation, implicit methods or specialized DAE solvers are often preferred because chemical and thermal systems can have very different time scales.

One subtle but important design decision is **how much of the existing steady-state solver to reuse**. The best approach is usually hybrid:

- Reuse property packages entirely.
- Reuse unit-operation constitutive equations where possible.
- Separate pure algebraic calculations from accumulation logic.
- Avoid embedding transient behavior directly into UI code.

For example, a separator or vessel can be refactored so the existing steady-state code computes phase equilibrium and outlet conditions from a given internal state, while new dynamic code handles inventory changes over time. This preserves validation effort and reduces duplication.

Another key concern is **initialization**. Dynamic simulation almost always starts from a consistent steady-state solution. That means the user solves the flowsheet in steady-state first, then maps the resulting stream conditions into unit inventories and internal energies. Poor initialization can cause the transient solver to fail immediately because the algebraic and differential parts are inconsistent.

Finally, realistic dynamic simulation usually requires control infrastructure. Even a simple tank model becomes more useful when a PID controller manipulates outlet flow to maintain level. Architecturally, controllers can be treated like special dynamic blocks with their own internal state, inputs from process measurements, and outputs connected to valves, pumps, or heat duties.

In short, building dynamic simulation into DWSIM-like software means moving from a one-shot algebraic solve to a repeated cycle of state evaluation, derivative calculation, integration, and stream/property recomputation. The thermodynamics layer remains central, but unit operations need explicit inventories and the solver needs a time-domain engine.

## Training Exercise

Build a minimal dynamic process model outside DWSIM to understand what the simulator must do internally.

### Goal
Implement a dynamic perfectly mixed tank with one inlet and one outlet, tracking:

- total mass in the tank
- component A mass fraction
- temperature

### Assumptions
- Constant liquid density
- Perfect mixing
- Constant heat capacity
- Outlet flow proportional to liquid level
- No reaction

### Step 1: Write the governing equations
Let:

- `M` = mass in tank
- `wA` = mass fraction of component A in tank
- `T` = tank temperature
- `Fin`, `Fout` = inlet/outlet mass flow rates
- `wA_in`, `Tin` = inlet composition and temperature
- `Q` = heat input
- `Cp` = heat capacity

Equations:

```text
dM/dt = Fin - Fout

d(M*wA)/dt = Fin*wA_in - Fout*wA

d(M*Cp*T)/dt = Fin*Cp*Tin - Fout*Cp*T + Q
```

If outlet flow depends on inventory:

```text
Fout = k * M
```

### Step 2: Implement a simple simulator in Python

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# parameters
Fin = 1.0          # kg/s
wA_in = 0.8
Tin = 350.0        # K
Q = 20_000.0       # W
Cp = 4000.0        # J/kg-K
k = 0.02           # 1/s

dt = 0.5
steps = 400

# initial state
M = 100.0          # kg
wA = 0.2
T = 300.0

time = []
Ms, wAs, Ts, Fouts = [], [], [], []

for i in range(steps):
    t = i * dt
    Fout = k * M

    dMdt = Fin - Fout
    dMwAdt = Fin * wA_in - Fout * wA
    dMEdt = Fin * Cp * Tin - Fout * Cp * T + Q

    M_new = M + dt * dMdt
    MwA_new = M * wA + dt * dMwAdt
    ME_new = M * Cp * T + dt * dMEdt

    wA_new = MwA_new / M_new
    T_new = ME_new / (M_new * Cp)

    M, wA, T = M_new, wA_new, T_new

    time.append(t)
    Ms.append(M)
    wAs.append(wA)
    Ts.append(T)
    Fouts.append(Fout)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.subplot(3,1,1)
plt.plot(time, Ms)
plt.ylabel('Mass (kg)')

plt.subplot(3,1,2)
plt.plot(time, wAs)
plt.ylabel('wA')

plt.subplot(3,1,3)
plt.plot(time, Ts)
plt.ylabel('T (K)')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Step 3: Perform transient experiments
Run these variations and explain the response:

1. Increase `Fin` by 20% at `t = 50 s`.
2. Set `Q = 0` and compare temperature evolution.
3. Increase `k` to make the outlet more responsive.
4. Change the initial composition and observe mixing behavior.

### Step 4: Map the exercise back to DWSIM
For each variable, identify what a DWSIM dynamic unit would need:

- `M`: internal holdup state
- `wA`: composition state or component inventory vector
- `T`: energy state
- `Fout`: algebraic equation from equipment hydraulics
- `Tin`, `wA_in`: stream inputs from upstream units

### Step 5: Stretch goal
Add a simple proportional controller to maintain mass near a setpoint by manipulating `Fout`:

```python
M_sp = 80.0
Kc = 0.01
Fout = max(0.0, k * M + Kc * (M - M_sp))
```

Then compare open-loop and closed-loop responses. This is a good mental model for why dynamic simulation in a process simulator must include both state integration and control logic.
