## Overview

These notes explain how GitHub Copilot hooks can be used as a control layer around AI-assisted development, especially to enforce quality and safety before tools are allowed to run. The main emphasis is on `PreToolUse`, a hook that can inspect intended actions and deny them when they violate policy, such as failing lint checks, touching protected files, or attempting unsafe commands.

This matters because AI coding tools increasingly do more than suggest text: they edit files, run commands, and coordinate workflow steps. Hooks make that behavior governable. Instead of relying on the model to follow team conventions voluntarily, engineers can encode rules directly into the execution path and provide feedback that pushes the assistant toward compliant behavior.

## Key Concepts

- **Hooks**: Programmable interception points in an AI-assisted workflow. They let you inspect, allow, modify, or deny actions before or after the assistant performs a tool call or related operation.
- **PreToolUse**: A hook that runs before Copilot invokes a tool. Its practical value is policy enforcement: if a planned action violates constraints such as lint cleanliness, file safety, or repository rules, the hook can block the action.
- **Tool call denial**: Denying a tool call means the assistant is not allowed to perform the requested operation. This moves quality control from post-generation cleanup to pre-execution enforcement, which is safer and usually cheaper.
- **Quality gates for AI**: Automated rules that code or actions must satisfy before proceeding. In this context, examples include requiring a successful linter run, passing tests, or preventing writes to protected files.
- **Feedback loop design**: When a hook blocks an action, it should return a clear reason so the AI can try again with a better approach. Effective hooks do not just reject work; they guide remediation.
- **Workflow integration**: Hooks are most useful when integrated into tools engineers already use, such as the Copilot CLI or VS Code, so enforcement happens at the exact point where AI suggests, edits, or executes work.

## How It Works

The core idea is to treat hooks like middleware around AI actions. Copilot plans an operation, a hook runs at a defined lifecycle point, the hook evaluates policy or repository state, and then returns a decision such as allow or deny. If denied, Copilot must revise its plan.

`PreToolUse` is especially useful because it intercepts actions before code is written or commands are executed. That helps address a common failure mode in AI-assisted development: the model produces code that violates lint, formatting, or repository conventions, then keeps going as though nothing is wrong. By moving checks into the pre-execution path, those rules become hard constraints rather than suggestions.

A practical quality-control flow might be:

- Copilot proposes editing a file.
- A `PreToolUse` hook inspects the proposed action or current repository state.
- The hook runs a fast validation command such as `eslint`, `ruff`, `biome`, or `prettier --check`.
- If violations exist, the hook denies the action and returns a remediation message.
- Copilot must fix the issue before proceeding.

This approach is useful for more than linting. Teams can encode policy such as:

- blocking edits to protected files
- preventing dangerous shell commands
- requiring tests for changes in specific directories
- restricting modifications to the current project root
- enforcing consistency rules like only changing `package-lock.json` alongside `package.json`

The implementation tradeoff is strictness versus usability. If hooks are too strict, the AI may get stuck in repeated denial loops. If they are too loose, they add little value. Good hooks are:

- **Fast**: they keep the workflow interactive.
- **Deterministic**: the same input should produce the same result.
- **Actionable**: denial messages should clearly explain how to fix the issue.

A strong setup usually uses layered enforcement:

1. `PreToolUse` for fast, high-signal checks and safety rules.
2. Local lint/test commands for repository-specific correctness.
3. CI as the final enforcement layer for slower or broader validation.

The broader architectural takeaway is that hooks act as a control plane for AI-assisted development. They shift the question from “Will the model behave correctly?” to “What actions are permitted, under what conditions, and how are those conditions enforced automatically?”

Overview

This lesson explains the idea behind GitHub Copilot hooks as described in Burke Holland’s post, with a focus on the most practical use case: intercepting AI tool usage and enforcing quality gates before code is written or executed. The core message is that hooks give engineers a programmable control layer around AI-assisted development, turning Copilot from a best-effort assistant into something that can be constrained by team policy.

This matters to working engineers because AI code generation often produces code that compiles poorly, violates lint rules, or ignores local conventions. If hooks such as PreToolUse can deny unsafe or noncompliant tool calls, teams can require linting, tests, formatting, or other checks as part of the AI workflow rather than cleaning up after the fact.

Key Concepts

  *   Hooks: Hooks are programmable interception points in an AI-assisted workflow. They let you inspect, allow, modify, or deny actions before or after the assistant performs a tool call or related operation.
  *   PreToolUse: PreToolUse is a hook that runs before Copilot invokes a tool. Its practical value is policy enforcement: if a planned action violates constraints such as lint cleanliness, file safety, or repository rules, the hook can block the action.
  *   Tool call denial: Denying a tool call means the assistant is not allowed to perform the requested operation. This shifts quality control from post-generation cleanup to pre-execution enforcement, which is usually cheaper and safer.
  *   Quality gates for AI: A quality gate is an automated rule that code or actions must satisfy before proceeding. In the Copilot-hooks context, examples include requiring a successful linter run, passing tests, or preventing writes to protected files.
  *   Feedback loop design: When a hook blocks an action, the system needs to return a clear reason so the AI can try again with a better approach. Good hooks do not just reject work; they provide actionable feedback that guides the assistant toward compliant output.
  *   Workflow integration: Hooks become useful when they are embedded in the tools engineers already use, such as the Copilot CLI or VS Code. Integration matters because enforcement must happen at the point where AI suggests, edits, or executes work.

How It Works

The source describes hooks landing in both the GitHub Copilot CLI and Visual Studio Code, and highlights one especially valuable mechanism: intercepting tool use before it happens. The central idea is simple: Copilot is not just generating text, it is increasingly orchestrating actions such as editing files, running commands, and interacting with developer tools. Hooks provide a place to inspect those actions and decide whether they should proceed.

A useful mental model is to treat hooks like middleware around AI operations:

1. Copilot plans an action. 2. A hook runs at a defined lifecycle point, such as before tool invocation. 3. The hook evaluates policy or repository state. 4. The hook returns a decision: allow, deny, or possibly annotate with guidance. 5. Copilot either proceeds or must revise its plan.

The post emphasizes `PreToolUse` because it addresses a common failure mode in AI-assisted coding: the model writes code that violates lint or style rules, then continues as if everything is fine. With a pre-tool hook, you can refuse the tool call unless the operation meets your standards. In practice, that means you are no longer relying on the model to voluntarily follow quality rules. Instead, you make those rules part of the execution path.

A typical quality-control flow might look like this:

- Copilot proposes editing `src/app.ts`. - `PreToolUse` inspects the proposed change or the current repo state. - The hook runs a fast check such as `eslint`, `ruff`, `biome`, or `prettier --check`. - If violations exist, the hook denies the operation and returns a message like: "Fix lint errors before writing additional code." - Copilot must now revise the code or address the failure condition.

That changes the AI interaction model in an important way. Without hooks, the AI can generate code first and hope validation happens later. With hooks, validation becomes a hard constraint. This is especially useful for:

- enforcing style and lint compliance - protecting critical files from modification - preventing dangerous shell commands - requiring tests before merge-related actions - ensuring generated changes stay within repo or workspace boundaries

The source also hints at the broader power of hooks beyond linting. If you can intercept tool usage, you can encode team policy directly into the AI workflow. For example:

- Block edits to `package-lock.json` unless `package
