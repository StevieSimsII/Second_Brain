## Overview

This lesson examines AI infrastructure through the physical and economic constraints implied by the themes "watts, wafers, and the future of AI infra." Instead of treating AI progress as purely a software story, it frames modern AI systems as the product of three hard bottlenecks: electrical power, semiconductor manufacturing capacity, and the capital-intensive design of data centers and accelerator clusters.

This matters to engineers building ML platforms, distributed systems, chips, or cloud infrastructure because model capability increasingly depends on supply chains and systems engineering as much as algorithms. If you work on training systems, inference serving, hardware planning, or capacity strategy, understanding these constraints helps explain why certain architectures win, why utilization matters, and where the next bottlenecks are likely to emerge.

## Key Concepts

- **Power as a first-class constraint**: Large-scale AI is bounded by available electrical power at both the server and facility level. Training and inference demand dense compute deployments, which create challenges in rack power delivery, cooling, and utility interconnects. As clusters scale, securing megawatts can become as important as securing GPUs.
- **Wafer supply and advanced packaging**: AI accelerators depend on leading-edge semiconductor fabrication and specialized packaging such as HBM integration and chiplet assembly. Even when chip designs are ready, limited foundry slots, packaging throughput, and memory supply can cap deployment. This means AI growth is tied to manufacturing ecosystems, not just model demand.
- **Compute is a systems problem**: Useful AI throughput comes from the interaction of accelerators, networking, storage, memory bandwidth, and software orchestration. A cluster with powerful chips but weak interconnects or poor scheduling may underperform badly. End-to-end system balance determines delivered performance.
- **Training versus inference economics**: Training often concentrates spend into large, bursty compute campaigns, while inference creates ongoing, latency-sensitive operating costs. The optimal hardware, topology, and software stack can differ across these workloads. Understanding which side dominates your business is critical to infrastructure design.
- **Utilization and capital efficiency**: AI infrastructure is expensive, so idle capacity is a major economic drag. High utilization requires careful workload scheduling, software reliability, and matching cluster design to workload patterns. Organizations that convert capital expenditure into sustained useful compute gain a structural advantage.
- **Bottleneck migration**: As one constraint is improved, another typically becomes dominant: from compute to memory, from chips to power, or from model training to inference serving. Engineers should expect bottlenecks to shift over time rather than disappear. Good strategy comes from identifying the next limiting factor before it becomes urgent.

## How It Works

A practical way to understand the "watts and wafers" framing is to follow the AI infrastructure stack from demand to delivered tokens or training steps.

First, **model demand** creates a need for compute. Larger models, longer context windows, and broader product adoption increase total FLOPs required for training and inference. But demand for FLOPs does not automatically translate into deployed capability. It must pass through several physical gates.

Second, **semiconductor supply** determines how much accelerator hardware can actually be built. This includes:

- Leading-edge wafer capacity at foundries
- Advanced packaging capacity
- HBM memory availability
- Board, server, and rack-level integration

A useful mental model is that an accelerator is not just a chip. It is a stack of tightly coupled supply chains. If one piece is constrained, total output stalls.

Third, **data center power and cooling** determine how much hardware can be installed and operated. Even if accelerators are available, operators need:

- Utility power access
- Substation and power distribution equipment
- Cooling systems capable of handling high rack densities
- Space, permitting, and construction timelines

This is why AI data center planning increasingly looks like industrial infrastructure planning. Deployment lead times can be driven by grid interconnection or facility retrofits rather than server procurement.

Fourth, **cluster architecture** determines whether the available hardware produces useful throughput. At a high level, the flow looks like this:

```text
Model workload
  -> scheduler/orchestrator
  -> accelerator cluster
  -> network fabric
  -> storage + checkpointing
  -> monitoring + reliability systems
  -> delivered training progress or inference tokens
```

Within this flow, several engineering tradeoffs matter:

- **Training clusters** prioritize high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnects for collective communication.
- **Inference systems** often prioritize memory footprint, request batching, latency SLOs, and cost per token.
- **Storage systems** matter because checkpoints, datasets, and logs can become operational bottlenecks.
- **Software stack quality** matters because failures, restarts, or poor kernel efficiency waste expensive hardware time.

Fifth, **economics** sit on top of the physical system. The key question is not simply "How many GPUs do we own?" but rather:

- What is cost per effective training run?
- What is cost per million output tokens at target latency?
- What utilization can we sustain?
- Where is capital stranded due to supply or power constraints?

This leads to an important systems insight: the winning AI infrastructure strategy is usually not the one with the single best chip, but the one that best converts scarce inputs into reliable, scalable compute output.

A helpful engineering framework is to evaluate AI infra across three layers:

1. **Inputs**: power, wafers, memory, network gear, real estate, capital
2. **Conversion efficiency**: software stack, scheduling, topology, cooling, reliability
3. **Business output**: model quality, training velocity, inference cost, product responsiveness

When analyzing future AI infrastructure, ask where the next choke point is likely to emerge. For example:

- If chips become easier to buy, does power become the main limiter?
- If training gets cheaper, does inference volume dominate total spend?
- If model architectures become more efficient, does memory bandwidth remain the bottleneck?

This reasoning style is more durable than any one market forecast because it focuses on system constraints and their interactions.

## Training Exercise

Build a simple AI infrastructure bottleneck model in a spreadsheet or Python notebook.

### Goal
Estimate which of three constraints limits a hypothetical AI deployment first:

1. accelerator availability
2. data center power
3. inference demand economics

### Step 1: Define a toy scenario
Assume:

- 10,000 AI accelerators available
- 700 W per accelerator at the device level
- 1.3x overhead for full server/facility power allocation
- 50 MW total facility power available for IT + overhead budgeting
- 200 tokens/sec per accelerator for your inference workload
- Target demand of 1.5 billion tokens/day

### Step 2: Compute hardware-limited capacity
Calculate maximum token throughput from accelerator count.

```python
gpus = 10_000
tokens_per_sec_per_gpu = 200
tokens_per_day = gpus * tokens_per_sec_per_gpu * 86400
print(tokens_per_day)
```

### Step 3: Compute power-limited capacity
Estimate how many accelerators the facility can actually support.

```python
gpu_watts = 700
overhead_factor = 1.3
facility_watts = 50_000_000
effective_watts_per_gpu = gpu_watts * overhead_factor
power_limited_gpus = facility_watts // effective_watts_per_gpu
print(power_limited_gpus)
```

Then recompute tokens/day using `power_limited_gpus`.

### Step 4: Identify the binding constraint
Compare:

- accelerator-limited tokens/day
- power-limited tokens/day
- demand target tokens/day

Write down which constraint binds first.

### Step 5: Run sensitivity analysis
Change one variable at a time:

- Increase facility power from 50 MW to 80 MW
- Decrease tokens/sec per accelerator by 30% to simulate a harder model
- Double demand
- Improve facility efficiency by reducing overhead factor from 1.3 to 1.15

For each change, note how the bottleneck shifts.

### Step 6: Extend to training
Add a rough training scenario with:

- total training FLOPs needed
- accelerator FLOPs per second
- expected utilization
- network/software efficiency factor

Estimate wall-clock training time and compare how much utilization loss changes the result.

### What to learn
By the end, you should be able to explain why AI infra planning is not just about buying chips. The practical question is which scarce resource limits delivered compute first, and what engineering or procurement move most effectively relaxes that limit.
