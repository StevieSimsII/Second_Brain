## Overview

This lesson turns a sparse video reference about testing a frontier language model over a month into a practical framework for engineers who need to evaluate new LLMs systematically. Instead of focusing on marketing claims, it shows how to compare a model across realistic workflows such as coding, writing, analysis, and reliability under repeated use.

If you are choosing between models for engineering teams, internal tooling, or AI-assisted development, a structured evaluation process matters more than a one-off demo. The goal here is to help you build a repeatable test harness, define useful criteria, and interpret results in a way that leads to better deployment decisions.

## Key Concepts

- **Long-horizon model evaluation**: A useful model assessment should happen over days or weeks, not just a single session. Real strengths and weaknesses emerge through repeated use across varied tasks, especially when you track consistency, failure modes, and adaptation to different prompting styles.
- **Task-based benchmarking**: Generic benchmark scores rarely map cleanly to your actual work. A stronger approach is to define representative tasks such as debugging code, summarizing documents, planning architecture, or generating tests, then measure model performance directly on those tasks.
- **Qualitative and quantitative scoring**: Evaluation should combine hard metrics like latency, cost, and success rate with softer criteria like clarity, initiative, and usefulness. This mixed method captures both operational viability and human-perceived value.
- **Prompt robustness**: A strong model should perform well even when prompts are imperfect, underspecified, or iteratively refined. Testing prompt robustness helps distinguish models that require careful prompt crafting from those that generalize well in everyday use.
- **Failure mode analysis**: It is not enough to note that a model failed; you should classify how it failed. Common categories include hallucination, incomplete reasoning, incorrect code changes, overconfidence, instruction drift, and context loss.
- **Model fit for workflow**: Different models excel at different jobs. The best model for exploratory ideation may not be the best for exact code transformations or fact-sensitive business tasks, so evaluation must be tied to intended usage.

## How It Works

A month-long LLM test is best understood as an engineering evaluation loop rather than a casual review. The process starts by defining a fixed set of workflows that represent real usage. For a software engineer, that might include code generation, code review, refactoring, debugging, documentation writing, architecture Q&A, and data analysis. For each workflow, you prepare multiple tasks with known expectations so you can compare outputs over time.

Next, build a scoring rubric. A practical rubric usually includes:

- **Accuracy**: Did the model produce a correct or mostly correct result?
- **Completeness**: Did it address all parts of the request?
- **Latency**: How long did it take to respond?
- **Edit distance to usefulness**: How much human correction was required?
- **Reliability**: Did it behave consistently across similar prompts?
- **Cost efficiency**: Was the quality worth the token or subscription cost?

The evaluation should include both **first-pass performance** and **iterative performance**. First-pass performance tells you whether the model is useful in fast workflows where you want a good answer immediately. Iterative performance tells you whether the model improves effectively when given feedback, which matters for pair-programming and research tasks.

A practical testing loop might look like this:

1. Choose 20-50 recurring tasks from your real work.
2. Save the exact prompts and any supporting context.
3. Run the same tasks on the target model and one or two comparison models.
4. Score each output using a consistent rubric.
5. Record notable failures and surprising successes.
6. Repeat over multiple weeks as your usage broadens.

One of the most important mechanics is separating **novelty** from **utility**. New models often feel impressive in early sessions because they phrase answers confidently or appear more fluent. Over longer periods, what matters more is whether they reduce rework, catch subtle issues, and remain dependable when tasks become ambiguous or messy.

You should also test across multiple prompt styles:

- Short, direct prompts
- Detailed specification prompts
- Multi-turn refinement
- Context-heavy prompts with pasted logs or code
- Adversarial or ambiguous prompts

This reveals whether the model needs heavy prompt engineering to succeed. In day-to-day engineering work, models that tolerate imperfect prompts often create more value because they reduce the operator burden.

A useful way to structure your findings is with a table like this:

```text
Task Category | Success Rate | Avg. Latency | Avg. Rework | Common Failure
Coding        | 78%          | 12s          | Medium      | subtle logic bugs
Debugging     | 65%          | 18s          | High        | wrong root cause
Docs          | 90%          | 8s           | Low         | mild repetition
Planning      | 84%          | 10s          | Medium      | vague tradeoffs
```

From there, draw conclusions by workflow rather than trying to crown a universal winner. For example:

- Model A may be best for document synthesis and broad planning.
- Model B may be stronger for precise code edits.
- Model C may be cheap enough for high-volume draft generation but too unreliable for production-facing tasks.

If the video's thesis is that a model was tested for a month, the durable lesson is that serious LLM evaluation requires **repeated, instrumented usage**. The real question is not "Is this model smart?" but "Under what conditions does this model reliably improve my work?" That framing leads to better technical and product decisions.

## Training Exercise

Build your own two-week LLM evaluation harness for engineering work.

### Goal
Compare two models on realistic tasks and decide which one is better for your actual workflow.

### Step 1: Create task categories
Pick 4 categories and write 3 tasks for each. Example categories:

- Code generation
- Debugging
- Test writing
- Technical documentation

Make each task concrete. Example:

- "Given this Python function and failing test output, identify the bug and propose a fix."
- "Write unit tests for this edge-case-heavy parser."

### Step 2: Define a scoring rubric
Score each response from 1-5 on:

- Correctness
- Completeness
- Clarity
- Rework required

Also record:

- Response time
- Approximate cost
- Whether the answer was usable on the first try

### Step 3: Create a simple results sheet
Use a CSV or spreadsheet with columns like:

```text
model,task_id,category,correctness,completeness,clarity,rework,latency_s,usable_first_try,notes
```

### Step 4: Run both models on the same tasks
Keep prompts identical for the first pass. Then do one follow-up turn where you ask for corrections or improvements.

### Step 5: Summarize outcomes
At the end, calculate:

- Average score by category
- First-pass success rate
- Average latency
- Most common failure types

### Optional: automate scoring capture with Python

```python
import csv
from statistics import mean

rows = []
with open("results.csv", newline="") as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    rows = list(reader)

for category in sorted(set(r["category"] for r in rows)):
    cat = [r for r in rows if r["category"] == category]
    avg_correctness = mean(float(r["correctness"]) for r in cat)
    avg_rework = mean(float(r["rework"]) for r in cat)
    print(category, round(avg_correctness, 2), round(avg_rework, 2))
```

### Deliverable
Write a 1-page conclusion answering:

1. Which model is best for which task category?
2. Where did each model fail most often?
3. Did the more impressive model actually save more time?
4. Would you deploy it for production-assisted workflows, personal productivity, or not at all?
