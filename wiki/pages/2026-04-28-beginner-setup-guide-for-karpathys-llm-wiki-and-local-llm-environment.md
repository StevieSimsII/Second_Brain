## Overview

These notes describe a practical beginner setup for studying Karpathy-style LLM material locally. The emphasis is on building a dependable environment for reading, running scripts and notebooks, downloading small models, and experimenting without getting blocked by package conflicts, device issues, or broken installs.

This matters because LLM workflows are especially sensitive to environment problems: Python version mismatches, CUDA or Apple Silicon compatibility, dependency conflicts, notebook setup, cache management, and hardware limits. A good setup is part of the learning process itself. The goal is not just to install tools once, but to create a reproducible workspace that supports repeated experimentation and gradual progress from tiny models to larger ones.

## Key Concepts

- **Reproducible Python environments**: Use a dedicated virtual environment to isolate dependencies from system Python and other projects. This helps avoid version conflicts between packages like PyTorch, Jupyter, tokenizers, and transformers.
- **CPU vs GPU execution**: Most beginner experiments can run on CPU, but GPU support changes installation choices and performance expectations. Knowing whether you need CPU-only, CUDA-enabled, or Apple Silicon builds prevents wasted setup effort.
- **Dependency compatibility**: LLM tooling often depends on tightly coupled versions of PyTorch, CUDA, and tokenizer libraries. Prefer known-good combinations over always installing the newest packages.
- **Notebook and script workflow**: Notebooks are useful for exploration, while scripts are better for repeatable checks and experiments. A solid setup should support both from the beginning.
- **Model artifacts and caching**: LLM work requires downloading tokenizers, weights, and datasets that are cached locally. Understanding cache behavior helps with storage, portability, and debugging.
- **Small-first experimentation**: Start with tiny checkpoints and lightweight tasks to validate the environment quickly. This separates setup issues from model or algorithm issues.

## How It Works

A good beginner setup has four layers:

1. **System tooling**: Python, terminal, package manager, and optionally Git.
2. **Project isolation**: a virtual environment dedicated to LLM work.
3. **Core libraries**: PyTorch plus common NLP/ML packages.
4. **Interactive workflow**: Jupyter, scripts, and model download support.

A reliable process starts with checking the machine:

- Confirm Python version.
- Determine whether a GPU is available.
- Choose the correct package path: CPU-only, CUDA, or Apple Silicon.
- Verify there is enough disk space for environments and cached models.

Next, create an isolated environment. This makes installs safer and lets you recreate or roll back the setup if dependencies break. A minimal package set typically includes:

- `torch`
- `jupyter` or `ipykernel`
- `transformers`
- `tokenizers`
- `datasets`
- `numpy`
- plotting tools such as `matplotlib`

After installation, run a **sanity-check loop** rather than jumping straight into a larger model:

- Verify Python runs.
- Verify imports succeed.
- Check whether PyTorch sees the expected device.
- Load a tokenizer.
- Run a tiny model for one inference pass.

This staged validation makes failures easier to diagnose. Import errors usually mean dependency issues. Missing GPU detection points to backend or driver problems. Model loading failures often indicate network, cache, or compatibility issues.

A minimal validation script can test the entire chain:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

print('torch:', torch.__version__)
print('cuda available:', torch.cuda.is_available())

model_name = 'sshleifer/tiny-gpt2'
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

inputs = tokenizer('Large language models are', return_tensors='pt')
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=20)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

This verifies package installation, model and tokenizer download, inference, and decoding while keeping memory and runtime requirements low.

The notes also frame this environment as part of a personal technical wiki. That means the workspace should support both study and execution. A practical directory layout is:

```text
llm-wiki/
  notes/
  notebooks/
  scripts/
  env/
  requirements.txt
  README.md
```

This keeps durable knowledge separate from experiments:

- `notes/` for summaries and explanations
- `notebooks/` for exploration
- `scripts/` for repeatable checks
- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for dependency tracking

Hardware limitations should shape expectations. On CPU, focus on small models and concepts like tokenization, prompt formatting, and forward-pass mechanics. On GPU, confirm that the GPU is actually being used before trying larger checkpoints. Many beginners install GPU-capable packages but accidentally run on CPU due to mismatched CUDA libraries.

Finally, the setup is only truly useful if it is reproducible. Record exact commands, save dependency versions, and keep a tiny validation script in the repo. That script becomes a known-good baseline whenever you update packages or move to a new machine.

Overview

This lesson distills the likely goals of a beginner setup guide for Karpathy’s LLM Wiki: getting a practical local environment ready for studying, running, and experimenting with modern language model tooling. The focus is not on theory alone, but on building a dependable workstation setup so you can follow tutorials, run notebooks or scripts, inspect model behavior, and iterate without fighting your tooling.

This matters because LLM learning is unusually sensitive to environment issues: Python versions, CUDA compatibility, package conflicts, notebook setup, model downloads, and memory limits can all derail progress. A working engineer who wants to learn LLMs efficiently should treat setup as part of the curriculum, building a reproducible workflow that supports reading, experimentation, and small-scale model execution.

Key Concepts

  *   Reproducible Python environments: A dedicated environment isolates project dependencies from your system Python and from other projects. This prevents version conflicts across libraries like PyTorch, Jupyter, tokenizers, and transformers. Tools such as venv, conda, or uv make it easier to recreate the same setup later.
  *   CPU vs GPU execution: Most LLM tooling can run on CPU for learning and debugging, but meaningful inference or training often benefits heavily from a GPU. The setup choices differ depending on whether you need CUDA-enabled PyTorch, Apple Silicon acceleration, or CPU-only builds. Understanding your hardware constraints helps you choose compatible packages and realistic exercises.
  *   Dependency compatibility: LLM ecosystems depend on tightly coupled packages, especially around PyTorch, CUDA, and tokenizer libraries. A setup guide should emphasize selecting versions that are known to work together instead of always installing the latest release. This reduces installation failures and subtle runtime issues.
  *   Notebook and script workflow: Beginners often learn LLM concepts in notebooks, but production-style experimentation usually benefits from standalone scripts and a clear project structure. A good setup supports both: notebooks for exploration and scripts for repeatable runs. This balance helps transition from tutorial-following to actual engineering practice.
  *   Model artifacts and caching: Working with LLMs usually involves downloading large model weights, tokenizers, and datasets. These artifacts are typically cached locally, and knowing where they live helps with storage management, debugging, and reproducibility. It also matters when working offline or moving between machines.
  *   Small-first experimentation: A practical setup starts with tiny models and lightweight tasks before moving to larger checkpoints or fine-tuning. This validates the environment quickly and helps separate setup problems from algorithmic problems. It is the fastest path to confidence that your tooling is actually working.

How It Works

A beginner LLM setup guide usually has one central job: reduce friction between reading about language models and actually running code that demonstrates them. In practice, that means preparing four layers correctly:

1. **System tooling**: Python, package manager, terminal, and optionally Git. 2. **Project isolation**: a virtual environment for LLM work. 3. **Core libraries**: PyTorch and common ML/NLP packages. 4. **Interactive workflow**: Jupyter, scripts, and model downloads.

A robust workflow often starts by verifying the machine itself:

- Check Python version. - Confirm whether a GPU is available. - Determine whether you need CPU-only, CUDA, or Apple Silicon packages. - Ensure enough disk space for environments and model caches.

From there, create an isolated environment. The point is to avoid contaminating the global Python installation and to make rollback easy if a package upgrade breaks something. A minimal setup typically installs:

- `torch` - `jupyter` or `ipykernel` - `transformers` - `tokenizers` - `datasets` - `numpy` - `matplotlib` or similar plotting tools

The next step is a **sanity-check loop**. Instead of jumping straight into a large model, you verify each layer independently:

- Python runs - packages import successfully - PyTorch sees the expected device - a tokenizer loads - a tiny model runs one inference pass

That sequence matters because it narrows failures quickly. If
