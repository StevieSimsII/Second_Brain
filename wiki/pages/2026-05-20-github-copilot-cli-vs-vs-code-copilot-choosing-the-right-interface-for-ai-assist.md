## Overview

This lesson explains the practical differences between GitHub Copilot in VS Code and GitHub Copilot in the terminal/CLI, based on an engineer’s real-world experience where the CLI succeeded on a task that the editor-based experience struggled with. Although both products sit under the GitHub Copilot umbrella, they are not interchangeable: they differ in context visibility, plugin ecosystems, user interaction model, and the kinds of workflows they support best.

This matters for working engineers deciding how to integrate AI into daily development. If you build inside editors, automate from the terminal, or orchestrate agent-driven workflows, understanding these differences helps you choose the right Copilot surface for the job instead of assuming all Copilot experiences behave the same way.

## Key Concepts

- **Editor-native vs terminal-native AI**: VS Code Copilot is embedded directly into the editor, where it can participate in code authoring, inline completions, and chat against the current project. Copilot CLI operates from the terminal, which changes both the interaction style and the available context. The result is that each tool naturally fits different engineering workflows.
- **Workspace awareness**: The post frames VS Code Copilot as having awareness of the full workspace, which is a major advantage when reasoning about files, project structure, and nearby code. The CLI is described as having much less direct workspace awareness, though a commenter notes it can infer context from the directory where it is launched. In practice, editor tools tend to have richer structural context, while CLI tools rely more on current path, commands, and explicit inputs.
- **Model selection**: VS Code Copilot is highlighted as offering a model picker that allows the user to switch between models such as Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Opus. This matters because different models can behave differently on UI generation, refactoring, explanation, or agentic tasks. Choosing a model becomes part of engineering workflow optimization, not just a UI detail.
- **Plugin ecosystem fragmentation**: A key point in the source is that plugin formats do not overlap between VS Code Copilot and Copilot CLI. Even if the same underlying code or capability exists, each environment may require its own plugin packaging and installation path. For engineers building extensions or relying on tool integrations, this means portability across Copilot surfaces is not automatic.
- **Task-specific tool fit**: The motivating example is a UI generation task where VS Code Copilot produced HTML that did not render correctly, while the CLI approach worked when following the documentation’s recommendation. This illustrates an important engineering lesson: AI tooling performance can depend heavily on execution context and interface, not just on the model itself. Tool choice should be validated empirically on the target task.
- **Agent orchestration patterns**: Several comments suggest the CLI is better suited to agent-style workflows, where the developer supervises and directs work rather than hand-authoring every line in the editor. This reflects a broader shift toward using terminals, scripts, and remote agents as orchestration surfaces. The source also mentions a cloud agent option, reinforcing that Copilot now spans multiple execution environments.

## How It Works

At a high level, the source compares two separate product surfaces for GitHub Copilot:

1. **VS Code Copilot**: lives inside the IDE/editor.
2. **Copilot CLI**: lives in the terminal.

Even if they may connect to similar underlying AI capabilities, the mechanics of how they are used are different.

### VS Code Copilot workflow
In VS Code, Copilot operates in a rich development environment. The editor has access to open files, project structure, surrounding source code, and user interactions such as inline editing and chat prompts. That gives it several strengths:

- It can reason over code close to where you are editing.
- It can support interactive coding and debugging loops.
- It can expose UI features like a **model picker**, letting you switch models for different tasks.
- It is a natural fit for engineers who want to inspect generated code as they go.

The post specifically describes VS Code Copilot as seeing the entire workspace. Whether that is literally full awareness or practical access through editor context, the important engineering takeaway is that the editor surface is optimized for code-centric, file-oriented work.

### Copilot CLI workflow
Copilot CLI shifts the interaction into the terminal. Instead of acting like a coding assistant embedded in a file editor, it behaves more like a command-line agent or assistant. That changes the flow:

- You invoke it from a shell in the context of a directory or repository.
- It operates through commands and terminal output rather than inline editor decorations.
- It uses its **own plugin marketplace** and integration model.
- It can be better aligned with documentation-driven or automation-heavy workflows.

In the source example, the author was building a declarative agent with a Maps MCP UI. VS Code kept producing HTML that did not render correctly. After switching to the CLI because the docs recommended it, the task worked. That suggests the CLI path may have had better support for the expected tooling, prompting pattern, plugin, or execution environment.

### Why plugin differences matter
One of the most practical points in the post is that the plugin formats **do not overlap**. That means you should think of these as distinct extension ecosystems, even if they share branding.

Implications for engineers:

- A capability available in VS Code Copilot may not be drop-in compatible with Copilot CLI.
- A plugin author may need to package or adapt the same underlying logic for each environment separately.
- Installation locations, invocation methods, and configuration may differ.

So if a workflow depends on a specific plugin or agent integration, verify support on the exact Copilot surface you plan to use.

### The context tradeoff
The source frames the CLI as having "zero workspace awareness," while a commenter pushes back and says the CLI detects workspace from the directory it is launched in. The most balanced interpretation is this:

- **VS Code** tends to have richer, editor-level context: files, buffers, selections, and workspace metadata.
- **CLI** tends to have process-level and directory-level context: current folder, shell environment, invoked commands, and explicit inputs.

Those are different types of context, and one may outperform the other depending on the task. For example:

- Refactoring across open files: likely better in the editor.
- Running scripted or agentic workflows tied to docs/commands: often better in the terminal.
- Reproducing deterministic execution flows: often easier in the CLI.

### A practical decision model
Use **VS Code Copilot** when you want:

- inline coding assistance
- editor-native chat
- file-by-file inspection of generated code
- richer project context
- easy model switching inside the IDE

Use **Copilot CLI** when you want:

- terminal-first interaction
- command-oriented or automation-oriented workflows
- agent-style orchestration
- workflows recommended by CLI-specific documentation
- a tool that fits naturally alongside other terminal AI tools

### Emerging third option: cloud agents
A commenter also mentions a third mode: a **GitHub Copilot Cloud Agent** that can run jobs remotely and be accessed from the web. That expands the architecture from local editor and local shell to remote execution. For larger or hands-off tasks, this introduces a different operating model where the engineer defines the task, lets the agent work asynchronously, and then validates the result through PR checks or manual review.

The larger lesson is that "GitHub Copilot" is no longer a single product experience. It is a family of interfaces with different context models, extension systems, and workflow assumptions. Engineers should evaluate them the same way they would evaluate separate tools: based on task fit, ecosystem support, and the level of supervision they want during code generation.

## Training Exercise

Compare the two Copilot surfaces on the same task so you can observe the workflow differences directly.

### Goal
Run one small implementation task in both **VS Code Copilot** and **Copilot CLI**, then document which interface works better and why.

### Suggested task
Create a tiny HTML page with a button, a text input, and JavaScript that validates whether the input is a valid email address.

### Step 1: Create a test project
```bash
mkdir copilot-surface-comparison
cd copilot-surface-comparison
printf "<!doctype html><html><head><title>Test</title></head><body></body></html>" > index.html
```

### Step 2: Try the task in VS Code Copilot
1. Open the folder in VS Code.
2. Use Copilot Chat or inline prompting.
3. Ask for:
   - an email input field
   - a button
   - a validation message
   - minimal CSS styling
4. Apply the generated code.
5. Open the page in a browser and test valid/invalid emails.
6. Record:
   - Did it generate working code immediately?
   - Did it understand the file context?
   - Did you need multiple iterations?
   - Which model did you use?

### Step 3: Try the same task in Copilot CLI
1. In the same project directory, invoke Copilot CLI using the command pattern provided by your installed version.
2. Give the same prompt, for example:
```text
Generate a single-file HTML page for index.html with an email input, submit button, client-side email validation, and a status message. Keep it minimal and runnable in a browser.
```
3. Apply the output to `index.html`.
4. Reload in a browser and test the behavior.
5. Record the same observations as above.

### Step 4: Compare plugin/integration support
Check whether each environment exposes the integrations you would need for your real workflow:

- editor or terminal only
- model selection options
- plugin or extension availability
- workspace awareness
- ease of review and iteration

### Step 5: Write a short engineering conclusion
Answer these questions:

1. Which surface produced the better first-pass result?
2. Which surface was easier to steer?
3. Did editor context help, or did terminal simplicity help more?
4. For UI generation, scripting, or agent orchestration, which would you choose going forward?

### Stretch exercise
Repeat the comparison with a second task such as:

- generating a shell script
- refactoring a small JavaScript module
- creating a simple API client

This will help you determine whether your preference is task-specific or general.
