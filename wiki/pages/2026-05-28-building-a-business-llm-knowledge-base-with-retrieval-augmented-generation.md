## Overview

This lesson explains how to build an internal knowledge base for a business using large language models, document embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The goal is to let an LLM answer company-specific questions grounded in your own documents rather than relying only on its pretraining data.

Engineers care about this because a well-designed knowledge base can dramatically improve support, operations, onboarding, and decision-making while reducing hallucinations. The core challenge is not just calling an LLM API, but building a pipeline that ingests documents, chunks them well, indexes them for semantic search, retrieves the right context, and composes reliable answers.

## Key Concepts

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: RAG combines information retrieval with LLM generation. Instead of expecting the model to know everything, the system first fetches relevant snippets from a private corpus and then asks the model to answer using that context. This improves factuality, freshness, and business relevance.
- **Embeddings**: Embeddings are dense vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. By embedding both user queries and document chunks into the same vector space, you can perform similarity search to find content that is conceptually related even when the wording differs.
- **Chunking Strategy**: Large documents must be split into smaller passages before indexing. Good chunking preserves meaning, keeps related ideas together, and fits the model context window. Poor chunking harms retrieval because the system either loses context or retrieves overly broad, noisy passages.
- **Vector Search**: A vector database or similarity index stores embeddings and enables nearest-neighbor search. Given a query embedding, the system returns the most semantically similar chunks. This is the retrieval layer that powers context selection for the LLM.
- **Grounded Prompting**: The final prompt should instruct the model to answer only from retrieved evidence, cite or summarize specific passages, and acknowledge uncertainty when context is insufficient. This reduces unsupported claims and makes the output more trustworthy in business settings.
- **Knowledge Base Freshness**: Business information changes constantly: policies, product docs, pricing, runbooks, and customer notes all evolve. A useful knowledge base needs repeatable ingestion and re-indexing workflows so the retrieval layer reflects current information.

## How It Works

A business LLM knowledge base is usually built as a pipeline with five stages: ingestion, preprocessing, embedding, retrieval, and answer generation.

First, the system ingests source material such as PDFs, internal wikis, support docs, meeting notes, or exported SaaS data. Raw documents are cleaned into normalized text, and metadata is attached, such as source URL, owner, department, created date, and permissions. Metadata matters because retrieval often needs filtering by team, document type, or recency.

Second, the text is split into chunks. The chunk size is a practical engineering tradeoff:

- **Too small**: retrieval may return fragments without enough context.
- **Too large**: embeddings blur multiple topics together, and prompt context gets wasted.
- **Overlap helps**: repeating some text between chunks prevents important facts from being cut at boundaries.

Third, each chunk is converted into an embedding vector using an embedding model. The system stores:

- chunk text
- embedding vector
- metadata
- document/chunk IDs

These records go into a vector index or vector database. At query time, the user's question is embedded with the same embedding model and compared against stored vectors to retrieve the top-k most relevant chunks.

Fourth, the retrieval layer may apply ranking or filtering before generation. A typical flow looks like this:

```text
User question
  -> embed query
  -> vector similarity search
  -> optional metadata filters / reranking
  -> top relevant chunks
  -> prompt assembly
  -> LLM answer
```

Fifth, the prompt is assembled from the user question plus the retrieved passages. A strong prompt usually includes explicit instructions such as:

- answer only using the provided context
- say when the answer is not in the documents
- summarize concisely for the target audience
- include references to source snippets or document names

This architecture matters because it separates responsibilities:

- the **embedding/index layer** decides what information is relevant
- the **LLM** decides how to synthesize and present that information

That separation is why the system scales better than naive prompting. Instead of dumping an entire document repository into every prompt, you search first and only send a small, relevant working set to the model.

In practice, there are several important engineering refinements:

1. **Document parsing quality**: PDFs, tables, and slides often extract poorly. Bad parsing leads to bad retrieval.
2. **Chunk-level metadata**: Store source and access controls per chunk, not just per file.
3. **Reranking**: After initial vector retrieval, a reranker model can improve precision by reordering candidates.
4. **Evaluation**: Test with real business questions and verify whether the retrieved chunks actually contain the answer.
5. **Feedback loops**: Log failed queries, missing documents, and hallucinations to improve ingestion and prompting.

A minimal implementation often uses a workflow like this:

```python
# Pseudocode
chunks = chunk_documents(load_documents())
records = []
for chunk in chunks:
    vec = embed(chunk.text)
    records.append({
        "text": chunk.text,
        "vector": vec,
        "metadata": chunk.metadata,
    })
vector_db.upsert(records)

query_vec = embed(user_question)
results = vector_db.search(query_vec, top_k=5)
context = "\n\n".join(r["text"] for r in results)
answer = llm.generate(
    system="Answer only from provided context.",
    user=f"Question: {user_question}\n\nContext:\n{context}"
)
```

For business use, the difference between a toy demo and a production system is usually in the operational details: source connectors, scheduled syncs, permission-aware retrieval, observability, and evaluation. The core idea remains simple: retrieve the right company knowledge first, then let the model generate an answer grounded in that evidence.

## Training Exercise

Build a small internal-document Q&A prototype using a local folder of text files.

### Goal
Create a pipeline that indexes a handful of business documents and answers questions using retrieval plus an LLM.

### Step 1: Create sample documents
Make a folder called `docs/` and add 3-5 text files such as:

- `refund_policy.txt`
- `oncall_runbook.txt`
- `pricing_notes.txt`
- `employee_onboarding.txt`

Put realistic business content in each file.

### Step 2: Chunk the documents
Write a script that reads each file and splits it into chunks of around 300-600 characters with 50-100 characters of overlap.

### Step 3: Generate embeddings
Use any embedding API or local embedding model to create vectors for each chunk. Store them in a simple in-memory list, SQLite table, or vector store.

### Step 4: Implement retrieval
For a user question, embed the question and compute cosine similarity against all chunk vectors. Return the top 3-5 chunks.

### Step 5: Generate an answer
Pass the retrieved chunks to an LLM with instructions to answer only from the provided context.

### Step 6: Test with real questions
Ask questions like:

- "What is the refund window for annual plans?"
- "What should the on-call engineer do if database latency spikes?"
- "What does a new hire need to complete in week one?"

### Minimal pseudocode
```python
from pathlib import Path

files = list(Path("docs").glob("*.txt"))
texts = [(f.name, f.read_text()) for f in files]

# 1. chunk
chunks = []
for name, text in texts:
    size, overlap = 500, 80
    start = 0
    while start < len(text):
        end = start + size
        chunks.append({"source": name, "text": text[start:end]})
        start += size - overlap

# 2. embed chunks
for c in chunks:
    c["vector"] = embed(c["text"])  # replace with your embedding call

# 3. retrieve
q = "What is the refund window for annual plans?"
qv = embed(q)
ranked = sorted(chunks, key=lambda c: cosine_similarity(qv, c["vector"]), reverse=True)[:3]

context = "\n\n".join(f"[{c['source']}] {c['text']}" for c in ranked)

# 4. answer with LLM
prompt = f"Answer only from this context. If missing, say so.\n\nQuestion: {q}\n\nContext:\n{context}"
print(generate(prompt))
```

### Stretch goals

1. Add metadata filters, such as only searching `support` documents.
2. Compare two chunk sizes and measure answer quality.
3. Add source citations to every answer.
4. Log questions where retrieval failed and inspect why.
5. Re-index automatically when a file changes.

By the end, you should understand the full path from raw business documents to grounded LLM answers.
