## Overview

These notes cover the newer **Data Grid control** in **Power Apps Canvas Apps**, focusing on when it is a better fit than older patterns such as **Galleries** or the legacy **Data Table**. The main theme is that the Data Grid is designed for structured, tabular, high-volume record management where users need to review and edit many records quickly.

This matters because many internal business apps revolve around operational data in systems like **SharePoint**, **Dataverse**, or **SQL**. When the app experience is mostly about scanning rows, sorting/filtering records, and making quick inline updates, the Data Grid can reduce UI complexity, speed up CRUD workflows, and lower the amount of custom formula and layout work needed.

## Key Concepts

- **Structured data editing**: The Data Grid is intended for row-and-column scenarios where users work with standard fields across many records. It is less about rich visual layout and more about efficient management of tabular data.
- **Inline editing**: Users can update values directly in the grid without opening a separate form or detail screen. This is especially useful for repetitive operational changes such as status updates, assignment changes, or priority adjustments.
- **Grid vs Gallery vs Data Table**: Galleries are best when record layout needs to be highly customized. The Data Grid is better for standardized editable tables. The older Data Table overlaps somewhat, but the Data Grid offers a more modern interaction model.
- **Built-in sorting and filtering**: Common list-management behaviors are handled more naturally in the grid, reducing the need to manually recreate these capabilities with formulas and custom controls.
- **Connector-backed sources**: The control works well with common enterprise data stores such as SharePoint, Dataverse, and SQL, making it a practical front end for line-of-business apps.
- **Preview trade-offs**: Because the control may still vary by environment or release stage, teams should validate support for editing, delegation, customization, and behavior before using it broadly in production.

## How It Works

At a high level, the Data Grid shifts the screen design pattern from **“open a record to edit it”** toward **“edit records directly in place.”** Instead of building a screen from a Gallery template plus labels, text inputs, icons, and patch logic for every row, you bind the Data Grid to a tabular source and let the control provide the interaction surface.

This makes the control especially strong for operational throughput. In many business apps, users are not looking for a highly branded or card-based experience. They need to scan a queue, identify the right records, sort by urgency or date, and make small changes quickly while keeping surrounding context visible.

A typical setup looks like this:

- **Data source**: SharePoint list, Dataverse table, or SQL table
- **Main screen**: Data Grid bound to the data source
- **Support controls**: search box, filters, refresh button, record count, or action buttons
- **Editing model**: quick changes happen inline; more advanced edits can still open a form or separate detail screen

A common workflow:

1. Connect the app to a table such as `HelpdeskTickets`.
2. Configure the Data Grid to show key fields like `Ticket ID`, `Title`, `Status`, `Priority`, `Assigned To`, and `Created On`.
3. Let users sort and filter the records they care about.
4. Allow inline editing on permitted fields.
5. Save changes back to the underlying data source without forcing navigation away from the list.

This pattern is well suited to a helpdesk queue. An operator can scan the list and update fields like:

- `Status`: `New` → `In Progress`
- `Priority`: `Medium` → `High`
- `AssignedTo`: assign to a technician

The advantage is continuity: users keep their place in the list and can compare nearby records while making decisions.

A practical decision rule:

- Use **Data Grid** for high-volume tabular review and inline editing.
- Use **Gallery** for custom layouts, branding, or record-specific visuals/interactions.
- Use **Form controls** when editing requires heavy validation, guided workflows, or more complex business logic.

The main trade-off is flexibility. Because the grid is more opinionated than a Gallery, it may not support every custom interaction or visual pattern you want. In those cases, a hybrid design works well: use the grid for quick edits and a detail form for advanced updates.

Overview

Microsoft’s newer Data Grid control for Power Apps Canvas Apps is aimed at a common pain point in business app development: showing and editing structured tabular data efficiently without building a custom UI from multiple controls. Compared with older patterns such as Galleries or the legacy Data Table, the Data Grid emphasizes inline editing, built-in sorting and filtering, and a more modern enterprise-style user experience.

This matters to engineers and makers building internal tools like helpdesk systems, inventory apps, and employee management solutions. If your app centers on lists of records that users need to review and update quickly, the Data Grid can reduce navigation, simplify screen design, and improve productivity. It is especially relevant for teams already using SharePoint, Dataverse, or SQL as their data source.

Key Concepts

  *   Structured data editing: The Data Grid is designed for scenarios where users work with rows and columns of records rather than highly customized card-based layouts. Its main advantage is that users can view many records at once and edit fields directly in context.
  *   Inline editing: Inline editing lets users change values such as status, priority, or assignee without opening a separate detail screen or form. This shortens workflows and is especially useful in operational apps where many small updates happen throughout the day.
  *   Grid vs Gallery vs Data Table: A Gallery is best when you need flexible layout, branding, or custom visual composition per record. The Data Grid is best for standardized, editable, tabular data. The older Data Table covers similar territory but is increasingly less attractive because it offers a less modern experience and fewer advanced editing capabilities.
  *   Built-in sorting and filtering: Sorting and filtering are core behaviors for business users who need to find the right records quickly. Having these capabilities built into the grid reduces the amount of custom formula logic and UI plumbing required in the app.
  *   Connector-backed data sources: The control works with common enterprise data sources such as SharePoint, Dataverse, and SQL. This makes it a practical front end for line-of-business apps where the grid is simply a user interaction layer over existing operational data.
  *   Preview trade-offs: Because the control may still be in preview or evolving across environments, feature availability and behavior can vary. Teams should validate customization limits, delegation behavior, and editing rules before adopting it broadly in production apps.

How It Works

At a high level, the Data Grid changes the interaction model of a Canvas App screen from "select a row, navigate, edit in a form" to "inspect and edit directly in a table." Instead of composing a gallery template with labels, inputs, icons, and custom formulas for every row, you bind the grid to a tabular data source and let the control provide a structured editing surface.

The central idea is to optimize for operational throughput. In many business apps, users are not trying to consume rich visual layouts; they are trying to update lots of records accurately and quickly. A grid works well because it exposes multiple records at once, makes columns predictable, and supports familiar spreadsheet-like interactions.

A typical Canvas App design using the Data Grid looks like this:

- **Data source**: SharePoint list, Dataverse table, or SQL table - **Main screen**: Data Grid bound to the data source - **Optional supporting controls**: search box, filters, refresh button, and action buttons - **Record logic**: inline edits update fields directly; more complex actions can still open a form or detail screen

In practice, the workflow often looks like this:

1. The app connects to a tabular data source such as `HelpdeskTickets`. 2. The Data Grid is configured to show key columns like Ticket ID, Title, Status, Priority, Assigned To, and Created On. 3. Users sort or filter the dataset to focus on active records. 4. Users edit permitted fields directly in the grid. 5. The underlying data source is updated without forcing a full screen transition.

This is particularly effective in an IT helpdesk scenario. Instead of opening each ticket individually, an operator can scan the queue and make quick changes inline:

- Set a ticket from `New` to `In Progress` - Change `Priority` from `Medium` to `High` - Assign the ticket to a technician

That pattern improves both speed and usability because the context stays visible. The user does not lose their place in the list, and they can compare neighboring records while making decisions.

The comparison to older controls is important:

- **Gallery** - Best when each row needs a custom
