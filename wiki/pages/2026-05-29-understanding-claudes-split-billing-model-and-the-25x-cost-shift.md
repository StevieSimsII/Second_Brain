## Overview

This lesson explains a pricing and policy change described in the article "Everything That Went Wrong With Claude": Anthropic kept nominal subscription limits in place while moving several developer-facing workflows into a separate monthly credit pool priced like API usage. The practical outcome, according to the article, is that activities that previously felt covered by a subscription can now consume credits quickly and potentially create additional charges.

This matters to engineers, team leads, and platform owners who depend on Claude-related tooling such as the Agent SDK, `claude -p`, Claude Code GitHub Actions, or third-party apps built on the Agent SDK. If you are responsible for automation, CI usage, agentic workflows, or cost governance around LLM tooling, understanding the distinction between subscription entitlements and metered programmatic usage is essential.

## Key Concepts

- **Subscription limits vs metered credits**: A subscription often implies predictable access under a monthly fee, while metered credits behave more like pay-as-you-go consumption. The article’s central claim is that the visible subscription limits did not disappear, but some high-value workflows were reclassified into a separate bucket that depletes independently.
- **Programmatic usage classification**: Programmatic usage refers to interactions initiated by tools, SDKs, command-line automation, CI systems, or third-party integrations rather than direct human chat in the main product UI. Once these workflows are classified as API-like usage, they tend to inherit token-based or credit-based pricing rather than flat subscription behavior.
- **Separate monthly credit bucket**: A separate credit bucket is a distinct accounting pool for certain operations. Even if a user believes they are still within their subscription, those programmatic actions can exhaust this second pool and either stop working or spill over into billed usage.
- **Effective price increase**: The article frames the change as a 25x price increase because comparable work now draws from a more expensive pricing model. This is an example of an effective cost change: the interface may still say your plan is unchanged, but the operational cost per task can increase dramatically.
- **Tooling-specific billing impact**: The article specifically names Agent SDK, `claude -p`, Claude Code GitHub Actions, and third-party Agent SDK apps. That specificity matters because cost changes often do not hit every product surface equally; engineers must identify exactly which interfaces are metered differently.
- **Cost observability for AI workflows**: When AI usage spans chat interfaces, SDKs, background jobs, and CI pipelines, cost observability becomes a reliability concern, not just a finance concern. Without clear monitoring, teams can unknowingly move from bounded subscription behavior to bursty metered spend.

## How It Works

The article’s argument is about **billing architecture**, not model quality or prompt behavior. Its core claim is that Anthropic preserved the headline subscription limits while shifting a set of developer-oriented workflows into a distinct monthly credit system. Those workflows include:

- Agent SDK
- `claude -p`
- Claude Code GitHub Actions
- third-party apps built on the Agent SDK

The important mechanical idea is that there are now effectively **two ways usage is accounted for**:

1. **Subscription-style usage**: activity covered by the normal plan experience.
2. **Programmatic credit usage**: activity treated more like API consumption, charged against a separate credit pool.

That split changes the economics of common engineering workflows. A developer may assume they are using Claude under the same monthly plan they already pay for, but if the interaction comes through a CLI flag, SDK call, CI action, or integrated app, it may no longer count against the subscription in the same way.

In practice, the flow described by the article looks like this:

1. A user subscribes to a Claude plan and expects a known monthly envelope.
2. The user runs automated or semi-automated tooling such as an SDK-based agent or GitHub Action.
3. That activity is classified into a separate monthly credits bucket.
4. Credits deplete at API-like pricing rather than subscription-like economics.
5. Once credits are exhausted, the workflow either stops or converts into separately billable usage.

The article calls this a policy problem because the **headline limits appear stable**, while the actual cost model for valuable developer workflows changes underneath. From an engineering operations perspective, this is a classic case where the published plan description and the effective runtime behavior can diverge.

A useful way to reason about it is to separate **interface** from **billing path**:

- Same vendor does not imply same pricing behavior.
- Same account does not imply same quota bucket.
- Same model does not imply same marginal cost.
- Same subscription does not imply the same treatment for UI, CLI, SDK, and CI usage.

For teams, this means architecture decisions now affect billing directly. Consider these examples:

- A developer asking Claude a question manually in a UI may be covered differently than a script invoking `claude -p` repeatedly.
- A one-off coding task in an interactive environment may be cheap, while the same logic embedded in GitHub Actions becomes metered at scale.
- A third-party app built on the Agent SDK may feel like part of the product ecosystem, but still consume expensive programmatic credits.

This distinction is especially important for automation because automation amplifies usage. A task that seems inexpensive for one run can become costly when executed across:

- every pull request
- every branch build
- every nightly batch job
- every agent loop iteration

The article’s "25x" framing should be read as a warning about **effective unit economics**. Even if the exact multiplier varies by workflow or plan details, the broader lesson is that moving from subscription-covered activity to API-priced credits can create a drastic cost step-function.

Engineers should therefore treat AI billing policy changes as part of system design review. When evaluating a workflow, ask:

- Which product surface initiates the request?
- Is the request counted as interactive usage or programmatic usage?
- Which quota bucket is decremented?
- What happens at exhaustion: throttling, failure, or billable overage?
- Is there any alerting before a CI or agent workflow begins burning costly credits?

In short, the article describes a re-segmentation of Claude usage where developer-centric tooling is no longer economically equivalent to ordinary subscription usage. The lesson is not just about one vendor’s policy; it is about recognizing how AI platform billing models can materially alter the viability of engineering workflows.

## Training Exercise

Build a small **AI usage classification and cost audit** for your team’s Claude-related workflows.

### Goal
Identify which tasks are likely to be treated as subscription usage versus programmatic metered usage, then estimate the operational risk if pricing changes.

### Step 1: Inventory all Claude touchpoints
Create a table with these columns:

- Workflow name
- Trigger (human / script / CI / third-party app)
- Interface used (UI / CLI / SDK / GitHub Action / integration)
- Frequency per day
- Estimated prompts or runs
- Expected billing path
- Risk level

Example template:

```csv
workflow,trigger,interface,frequency_per_day,estimated_runs,billing_path,risk
interactive debugging,human,ui,10,10,subscription,low
pr review bot,ci,github_action,50,50,programmatic,high
batch code migration,script,sdk,5,5,programmatic,medium
local cli refactor,human,cli,8,8,programmatic,medium
```

### Step 2: Mark likely programmatic usage
Based on the article, flag these as likely to consume a separate credit bucket:

- Agent SDK
- `claude -p`
- Claude Code GitHub Actions
- third-party apps built on the Agent SDK

For each flagged workflow, write down why the workflow exists and whether it can be reduced, batched, or rate-limited.

### Step 3: Estimate cost sensitivity
For each programmatic workflow, answer:

1. What happens if available credits drop to zero?
2. Does the workflow fail safely?
3. Would overage create a surprise bill?
4. Can the workflow be turned off automatically?

Assign one of these labels:

- **Safe**: non-critical, easy to disable
- **Sensitive**: useful but not production-critical
- **Critical**: would block merges, releases, or key engineering tasks

### Step 4: Add a simple policy check
Write a lightweight script or pseudocode rule that blocks risky automation unless a budget flag is enabled.

```bash
if [ "$CLAUDE_AUTOMATION_BUDGET_APPROVED" != "true" ]; then
  echo "Claude automation disabled: no approved budget for metered programmatic usage"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Step 5: Produce an action plan
For your top 3 risky workflows, define:

- a daily or monthly usage cap
- an owner
- a fallback path if credits are exhausted
- whether the workflow should remain automated

### Stretch exercise
Draft a one-page internal note titled: **"When Claude usage is subscription-backed vs metered"**. Include examples from your environment so other engineers do not assume CLI or CI usage behaves like standard chat usage.
