## Overview

This lesson distills practical ways engineers can use a code-focused AI assistant like Codex as more than a chat tool: as a workbench for exploring code, generating changes, reviewing architecture, and automating repetitive development tasks. Even though the source content is only a video stub, the core topic clearly points to differentiated usage patterns—how experienced users get more leverage by changing workflow, not just prompts.

This matters to engineers who already use AI-assisted coding but feel they are underutilizing it. The biggest gains usually come from treating the model as a scoped collaborator with context, constraints, and verification loops, rather than asking for isolated snippets. The lesson focuses on practical, repeatable habits you can apply in a real repository.

## Key Concepts

- **AI as workflow, not autocomplete**: The highest-value use of Codex-style tools is not one-off code generation but end-to-end task assistance. That includes reading existing code, proposing plans, generating diffs, writing tests, and explaining tradeoffs. Thinking in workflows helps you compose multiple small interactions into reliable engineering output.
- **Context scoping**: Code models perform best when given the right slice of repository context, interfaces, and task boundaries. Instead of pasting everything, provide the relevant files, constraints, expected behavior, and acceptance criteria. Good scoping reduces hallucination and improves alignment with the existing codebase.
- **Plan-before-change prompting**: Before asking for code, ask the model to inspect the problem and propose an implementation plan. This surfaces assumptions, highlights affected modules, and gives you a checkpoint before changes are made. It also makes it easier to compare alternatives and catch risky edits early.
- **Diff-oriented iteration**: Engineers get more control when they ask for minimal, reviewable changes instead of full rewrites. A diff-oriented workflow encourages small patches, focused explanations, and fast validation. This mirrors how teams already work with pull requests and code review.
- **Verification loops**: AI-generated code should always be paired with tests, static analysis, or explicit manual checks. A strong workflow asks the model to define how success will be verified and to reason about edge cases. Verification turns AI output from plausible text into something closer to production-ready changes.
- **Role specialization**: The same model can be used in different roles: implementer, reviewer, debugger, test writer, or documentation assistant. Separating these roles in your prompts improves focus and reduces the chance that one response tries to do too much poorly. It also mirrors real engineering collaboration patterns.

## How It Works

A practical Codex workflow usually has five stages: understand, plan, change, verify, and document.

First, **understand the local system**. Instead of asking for generic code, start by giving the model repository-specific context: the relevant files, function signatures, failing behavior, and any architectural constraints. A strong opening prompt looks like: "Read these files, summarize how request validation currently works, and identify where a new authorization check belongs." This turns the interaction from open-ended generation into guided analysis.

Second, **have the model produce a plan before touching code**. The plan should identify:
- files to modify
- expected side effects
- edge cases
- tests to add
- anything unclear

This is often where expert users differ from casual users. They use the model to narrow ambiguity first, not just to emit code faster.

Third, **request small, bounded changes**. Instead of "rewrite authentication," ask for a minimal patch: "Add JWT expiration validation in `auth/middleware.py` and update unit tests only where needed." Small changes are easier to inspect, easier to revert, and more likely to match the repository's style and conventions.

Fourth, **make verification explicit**. Ask the model to state how to validate the result, including commands to run, expected outputs, and edge cases worth testing. For example:

```bash
pytest tests/auth/test_middleware.py
ruff check .
mypy src/
```

You can also ask the model to generate targeted tests before implementation. That is especially useful for bug fixing: first capture the failure in a regression test, then implement the fix.

Fifth, **use role-based passes**. After code generation, switch the interaction into reviewer mode:
- "Review this patch for correctness and hidden edge cases."
- "Act as a security reviewer and inspect only auth and input handling concerns."
- "Act as a performance reviewer and identify any new hot paths."

This separates creation from critique and often surfaces issues that a single-pass prompt misses.

A mature Codex workflow also treats prompts as lightweight tooling. You can keep reusable prompt templates for common tasks such as feature implementation, bug triage, test generation, migration planning, or refactoring. Over time, these templates become part of your engineering process.

A concrete pattern for repository work is:
1. Ask for a codebase summary of the relevant module.
2. Ask for an implementation plan.
3. Ask for a minimal patch.
4. Ask for tests covering expected and edge behavior.
5. Run the checks locally.
6. Ask for a review of the resulting diff.
7. Ask for concise documentation or PR notes.

This pattern is effective because it aligns with normal software development mechanics: local context, scoped changes, repeatable validation, and reviewable output. The AI is most useful when inserted into those mechanics rather than used as a magical replacement for them.

## Training Exercise

Use an AI coding assistant on a small local project and apply a plan-first, diff-oriented workflow.

1. Pick a small repository you can run locally.
   - Ideal choices: a CLI tool, small web API, or utility library.
   - Make sure it already has tests.

2. Choose one concrete task.
   Examples:
   - add input validation to one endpoint
   - fix a parsing bug
   - add a CLI flag
   - improve error handling for one function

3. Start with a context prompt.
   Paste only the relevant files and ask:

```text
Read these files and explain how this feature currently works.
Then identify the smallest set of changes needed to implement the task.
Do not write code yet.
```

4. Ask for an implementation plan.

```text
Produce a step-by-step plan with:
- files to modify
- functions to update
- tests to add or change
- possible edge cases
- risks or assumptions
```

5. Request a minimal patch.

```text
Implement the plan as a minimal diff.
Preserve existing style and avoid unrelated refactors.
After the patch, explain why each change was necessary.
```

6. Ask for verification steps.

```text
List the exact commands I should run to verify correctness, including tests, linting, and any manual checks.
```

7. Run the commands locally and inspect failures.
   - If something breaks, paste the error output back to the assistant.
   - Ask for a targeted fix, not a rewrite.

8. Do a review pass.

```text
Review the patch as if you were a strict code reviewer.
Focus on correctness, edge cases, and maintainability.
Suggest only necessary follow-up improvements.
```

9. Stretch goal: ask for PR notes.

```text
Write a short pull request summary with problem, solution, tests, and rollout risks.
```

Success criteria:
- you changed only the files needed
- tests pass locally
- the assistant helped with planning, implementation, and review
- you can explain why this workflow is better than asking for a full solution in one prompt
