## Overview

This lesson teaches a practical pattern for agentic engineering: use multiple AI models together instead of choosing a single winner. In the source, this pattern is called "model fusion" and is shown through a custom agent harness with three commands: `/opinion`, `/fusion`, and `/auto validate`. The central idea is to gather parallel perspectives, merge them into one decision-ready result, and validate implementation with an explicit gate written before the builder starts. The source argues that this improves planning and review, but most evidence shown is demo-based and anecdotal rather than a controlled benchmark, so treat the performance claims as observed examples rather than universal results.

## Key Concepts

- **And, Not Or**: The lesson rejects the idea of picking one best model. Instead, it recommends combining models so their different strengths, context windows, and reasoning styles contribute to better engineering decisions.
- **Model Fusion**: Model fusion is the practice of collecting outputs from multiple agents or models and consolidating them into a single result. The source presents it as a renamed but longstanding pattern related to architect-editor flows, prompt chaining, and agent chaining.
- **Parallel Opinions First**: The `/opinion` step asks two agents to solve the same problem independently. This is useful when you want multiple perspectives before committing to an architecture, implementation, or tradeoff.
- **Consensus, Divergence, and Discards**: The `/fusion` step does more than merge text. It identifies where agents agree, where they differ, and what ideas are dropped. That structure helps an engineer see tradeoffs instead of blindly accepting a single answer.
- **Validation Before Execution**: The `/auto validate` workflow has one agent write a validation script before another agent builds the solution. The builder then has to satisfy that gate, which turns review into an explicit, testable process rather than an informal check.
- **Harness Ownership**: The source strongly argues that the agent harness matters as much as the models. A customizable harness lets you define roles, prompts, validation rules, and coordination patterns instead of waiting for a vendor tool to support them.
- **Tight Coordination vs. Loose Delegation**: This pattern is presented as more than simple task splitting. The goal is a tightly coordinated team of agents that compare, fuse, validate, and loop on each other's work rather than acting as isolated subagents.

## How It Works

Start with two agents assigned the same engineering prompt. First, run an opinion step so both agents respond independently. Next, run a fusion step that combines the two outputs into one artifact while explicitly listing consensus points, divergences, and discarded ideas. Then run an auto-validation step: a validator agent writes a gate or test script before the builder begins, and the builder must produce work that passes that script. In the source, this pattern is used for example tasks like comparing scikit-learn models and designing a benchmark for bulk SQLite inserts. The claimed benefit is better decision quality and less manual review, because the engineer sees multiple viewpoints and receives implementation guarded by explicit checks. A careful reading of the source suggests the real reusable idea is not any specific model ranking, but the workflow shape: parallel reasoning, structured synthesis, and predeclared validation.

## Training Exercise

Pick a small engineering problem you can verify locally, such as choosing a data structure, comparing two API designs, or drafting a small benchmark. Write three prompts for a two-agent harness: 1. an `/opinion` prompt asking each agent for its independent recommendation with pros, cons, and assumptions, 2. a `/fusion` prompt asking a synthesizer to produce one final decision with sections for consensus, divergence, and discarded ideas, and 3. an `/auto validate` prompt asking a validator to define a concrete pass/fail script before implementation begins. After running the workflow, review whether the fused result actually exposed useful disagreements and whether the validation gate caught anything a normal single-agent flow would likely miss.
