## Overview

Spec Kit is a specification-driven development toolkit that treats specifications as active inputs to implementation rather than static documents. Instead of jumping directly from vague feature ideas into code, it guides engineers through a structured workflow: define intent, clarify ambiguity, choose an architecture, break work into tasks, analyze consistency, and then implement with an AI coding agent.

This matters for teams building software with AI assistance because the biggest failure mode is often not code generation itself, but poor requirements, inconsistent plans, and missing assumptions. Spec Kit is useful for engineers, tech leads, and product-minded builders who want a more repeatable way to turn product scenarios into working software using tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and similar agents.

## Key Concepts

- **Specification-driven development**: Specification-driven development makes the spec the primary artifact rather than treating it as temporary documentation. In Spec Kit, the specification captures what to build and why, and downstream steps derive plans, tasks, and implementation from that source of truth.
- **Structured slash-command workflow**: Spec Kit organizes work into explicit commands such as `/constitution`, `/specify`, `/clarify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/analyze`, and `/implement`. This creates a predictable sequence that reduces the chance of skipping critical design and validation steps before code generation.
- **Clarification before implementation**: A common problem in AI-assisted coding is starting with underspecified requirements. Spec Kit addresses this by inserting a clarification phase where the agent asks targeted questions, helping resolve ambiguity before a technical plan is created.
- **Executable specifications**: The toolkit's core idea is that specifications are not just read by humans; they are executed through AI agents into plans, tasks, and code. This narrows the gap between product intent and implementation artifacts.
- **Agent-agnostic integration**: Spec Kit is designed to work with multiple AI coding assistants rather than locking users into one environment. The same structured process can be used with Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and other supported agents.
- **Governance through constitution**: The `/constitution` step establishes project-wide principles such as testing expectations, UX consistency, or code quality standards. This gives the AI agent policy-level guidance that influences all later planning and implementation decisions.

## How It Works

Spec Kit provides a CLI called `specify` that bootstraps a project for use with an AI coding agent. The initialization step connects your repository or working directory to a specific agent environment:

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
specify --version
specify init my-project --ai claude
```

At a workflow level, Spec Kit breaks development into two broad phases.

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- `/constitution` defines the project's operating rules.
- `/specify` captures requirements, user stories, and product intent.
- `/clarify` resolves missing details through follow-up questions.

This phase is about improving input quality. Instead of prompting an AI with a loose feature request and hoping for good code, you build a better specification artifact first.

**Phase 2: Implementation**
- `/plan` converts the approved specification into a technical architecture and stack choice.
- `/tasks` decomposes the plan into actionable implementation work.
- `/analyze` checks consistency and coverage across the generated artifacts.
- `/implement` executes the task list to generate working code.

The mechanics are important: each step transforms the prior artifact into a more implementation-ready form. The process moves from product language to technical design to executable work items, which is exactly where many ad hoc AI workflows fail.

A practical example looks like this:

```text
/specify
Build a task management app with user authentication,
real-time collaboration, and mobile support.

/clarify
# answer questions about users, roles, sync model, and constraints

/plan
Use React with TypeScript, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database

/tasks
# generate the implementation breakdown

/analyze
# check requirements-to-task coverage

/implement
# generate the feature
```

The slash commands are the conceptual interface developers interact with after initialization. Even though the site content focuses on the user workflow rather than internal source layout, the architecture implied by the product is a pipeline:

1. **Project bootstrap via CLI**: `specify init` prepares a project and configures compatibility with the chosen AI agent.
2. **Specification capture**: the engineer writes natural-language requirements focused on behavior and value.
3. **Ambiguity reduction**: the agent collects missing constraints through structured questioning.
4. **Technical planning**: stack, architecture, frameworks, and implementation strategy are selected.
5. **Task generation**: the plan is decomposed into granular execution steps.
6. **Cross-artifact analysis**: consistency and completeness checks ensure the tasks still map to the original goals.
7. **Implementation**: the AI agent writes code according to the approved plan.

The `specify` CLI also includes operational commands and options that matter in real engineering environments:

- `specify check` validates system requirements.
- `specify init --here` initializes the current directory.
- `specify init ... --no-git` skips repository setup.
- `--debug` helps troubleshoot setup issues.
- Environment variables like `SPECIFY_FEATURE` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` support feature selection and enterprise GitHub access.

This workflow is especially valuable when building nontrivial apps such as Kanban tools, collaborative systems, or local media managers. In those domains, the challenge is rarely just writing CRUD code; it is preserving alignment between user intent, architecture, and execution. Spec Kit's structure is meant to make that alignment explicit and machine-actionable.

## Training Exercise

Use Spec Kit to define and plan a small but realistic feature: a shared note-taking app with authentication and offline support.

### Goal
Practice moving from idea to executable specification without skipping clarification and planning.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git 2.20+
- `uv` installed
- Access to a supported AI agent

### Steps
1. **Install the CLI**

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
specify --version
specify check
```

2. **Initialize a project**

```bash
specify init notes-app --ai claude
cd notes-app
```

3. **Define project rules**
   Run `/constitution` in your configured AI agent environment and provide constraints like:
   - Type safety is required
   - Unit tests for core business logic
   - Accessible UI patterns
   - Clear API boundaries

4. **Write the specification**
   Run `/specify` and use this prompt:

```text
Build a shared note-taking application for small teams.
Users can sign up, create notebooks, add notes, share notebooks with teammates,
and view recent edits. The app should support offline editing and sync changes
when the user reconnects. Mobile-friendly UI is required.
```

5. **Clarify missing details**
   Run `/clarify`. Answer questions such as:
   - What conflicts should happen during offline sync?
   - Are notebook permissions read-only or editable?
   - Is authentication email/password only or OAuth too?
   - What scale is expected for notes and attachments?

6. **Create the technical plan**
   Run `/plan` and choose a concrete stack, for example:

```text
Use React with TypeScript for the frontend, a Node.js API, PostgreSQL,
and service-worker-based offline caching. Prefer a sync strategy that is simple
and understandable over fully distributed conflict-free replication.
```

7. **Generate and inspect tasks**
   Run `/tasks` and review whether the output includes:
   - auth flows
   - notebook and note schemas
   - sharing permissions
   - offline caching and sync logic
   - test coverage
   - mobile responsiveness

8. **Run analysis**
   Run `/analyze` and look for missing coverage. If the analysis shows that offline conflict handling or permission edge cases are not represented, refine the spec or plan and regenerate tasks.

9. **Optional: implement**
   Run `/implement` and inspect whether the generated code follows the constitution and the task breakdown.

### What to evaluate
After the exercise, write a short engineering review answering:
- Which ambiguities did `/clarify` uncover that were missing from the initial prompt?
- Did the `/tasks` output fully cover the original product intent?
- What part of the workflow would have been easiest to skip in a normal AI coding session, and what risk would that create?

### Stretch goal
Repeat the same feature with a different AI agent, such as Copilot or Cursor, and compare whether the clarification questions, plan quality, and task decomposition differ.
