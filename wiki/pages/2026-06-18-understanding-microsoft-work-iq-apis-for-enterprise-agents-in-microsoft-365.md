## Overview

Microsoft Work IQ APIs expose the semantic intelligence layer that powers Microsoft Copilot to custom enterprise agents running inside the Microsoft 365 trust boundary. Instead of stitching together raw Microsoft Graph data, search pipelines, retrieval layers, and custom orchestration, engineers can call higher-level APIs that already understand organizational activity across email, calendar, meetings, chat, files, and collaboration signals.

This matters to teams building internal assistants, workflow agents, and knowledge tools for enterprises that care about security, grounded answers, operational efficiency, and cost controls. The core promise is that Work IQ gives agents direct access to tenant-bounded context, responses, actions, and persistent state, while preserving governance controls and potentially reducing token usage and implementation complexity.

## Key Concepts

- **Semantic intelligence layer**: Work IQ is described as the semantic layer behind Copilot. Rather than exposing only raw records, it continuously transforms M365 activity into a real-time organizational model that agents can query and act on.
- **Chat API**: The Chat API returns Copilot-grade responses with citations. This suggests grounded natural-language answers where the model can reference enterprise sources instead of generating unverified summaries from loosely retrieved data.
- **Context API**: The Context API aggregates agent-ready source data for downstream reasoning. It is aimed at reducing the amount of custom retrieval, normalization, and relevance plumbing that teams typically build on top of Graph or search APIs.
- **Tools API**: The Tools API provides a stable action surface for verbs and resources. In practice, this means agents can invoke enterprise actions through a consistent interface instead of integrating many low-level endpoints independently.
- **Workspaces**: Workspaces provide long-running agents with tenant-bounded persistent state. This is important for agents that need memory, task continuity, or multi-step execution without storing sensitive context outside the M365 boundary.
- **Tenant-bound governance**: A major design point is that data, context, and actions remain inside the Microsoft 365 trust boundary. Governance is not bolted on later; it is part of the platform model, paired with admin controls such as Copilot Credit spend limits.

## How It Works

Work IQ changes the integration level at which enterprise agents are built. A traditional architecture often looks like this:

- Fetch raw data from Microsoft Graph
- Build custom retrieval across email, files, chats, and calendars
- Chunk and rank content for LLM prompts
- Maintain your own agent memory or session state
- Add action adapters for calendar, mail, documents, or workflow tools
- Layer on cost controls and governance afterward

The Work IQ model instead exposes a higher-order semantic service already shaped around how agents operate. The source describes four API domains:

1. **Chat**
   - Used when the goal is to generate an answer or response.
   - Returns Copilot-like output with citations.
   - Best for question answering, summarization, stakeholder briefings, and conversational assistants.

2. **Context**
   - Used when the agent needs grounded source material and organizational context.
   - Aggregates relevant information across M365 activity into agent-ready inputs.
   - Best for planning, RAG-style workflows, meeting prep, and workflow routing.

3. **Tools**
   - Used when the agent must do something, not just answer.
   - Exposes verbs and resources through a stable action interface.
   - Best for workflows like scheduling, drafting, searching, filing, or enterprise task execution.

4. **Workspaces**
   - Used when the agent runs over longer periods or across multiple steps.
   - Stores persistent state inside the tenant boundary.
   - Best for recurring assistants, case management agents, and approval or research workflows.

A likely data flow for an internal enterprise agent built on Work IQ is:

- User asks a question or starts a task.
- The agent calls **Context** to gather tenant-grounded organizational signals.
- The agent optionally uses **Chat** to produce a cited answer or plan.
- If actions are required, the agent invokes **Tools**.
- Ongoing task state is saved in **Workspaces** for continuity.
- Admins monitor and control consumption with Copilot Credit governance in M365 admin.

This is strategically important because it shifts effort away from custom plumbing and toward product logic. The post claims two practical efficiency gains from internal testing:

- **2x faster runtime versus traditional APIs**
- **80% fewer tokens in coding harnesses**

If those numbers hold in real deployments, the savings come from reducing repeated prompt stuffing, retrieval overhead, and bespoke orchestration logic. The mention of progressive disclosure through MCP also implies that agents may be able to discover a concise set of generic tools first, only expanding capability surface when needed. That helps both latency and tool-selection reliability.

From an engineering perspective, the key architectural decision is whether your current Graph-based agent stack is solving a problem Work IQ now solves natively. If your team maintains custom retrieval pipelines, per-app connectors, prompt assembly logic, and state storage for M365-centric agents, Work IQ may collapse several layers of your design.

The governance model is equally central. In many enterprise agent systems, security and spend controls are added after prototypes succeed. Work IQ is positioned differently:

- Data remains inside the tenant trust boundary
- Actions execute within the same governed environment
- Spend can be capped at tenant, group, or user level using Copilot Credit controls

So the platform story is not only about model quality, but also about compliance posture, operational predictability, and reduced integration surface area.

## Training Exercise

Build a lightweight evaluation plan for migrating one internal M365 agent use case from a raw-API architecture to a Work IQ-style architecture.

### Goal
Compare a traditional Graph/RAG flow with a Work IQ-centered flow for one enterprise scenario, such as:

- meeting preparation assistant
- executive daily briefing bot
- internal knowledge Q&A assistant
- follow-up task extraction agent

### Step 1: Pick a current or hypothetical workflow
Write down:

- the user request
- the data sources needed: email, files, meetings, chat, calendar
- the actions required: summarize, draft, schedule, notify, save state

Example:

- Request: "Prepare me for my 2 PM customer meeting."
- Data: recent email thread, meeting invite, attached deck, Teams chat, CRM notes if available
- Actions: summarize, generate briefing, store follow-up notes

### Step 2: Map the traditional implementation
List the components you would normally build:

- Graph queries
- search/retrieval logic
- prompt assembly
- memory/state store
- action integrations
- citation or grounding logic
- cost monitoring

Create a simple table like this:

```text
Component                  Traditional approach
------------------------  -----------------------------------------
Data retrieval             Graph + search + custom ranking
Answer generation          LLM prompt with retrieved chunks
Actions                    Custom adapters per endpoint
Long-running state         External database or cache
Governance                 App-specific logging and budget checks
```

### Step 3: Remap it to Work IQ domains
For the same use case, assign each responsibility to one of the four domains:

- Chat
- Context
- Tools
- Workspaces

Example:

```text
Responsibility             Work IQ domain
------------------------  ----------------
Gather meeting materials   Context
Generate cited briefing    Chat
Schedule follow-up         Tools
Persist task state         Workspaces
```

### Step 4: Estimate engineering impact
For each architecture, estimate:

- number of API calls
- amount of prompt/context assembly code
- external state storage needed
- likely governance work
- likely token usage

Use a 1-5 score for complexity.

### Step 5: Define an evaluation rubric
Score both approaches on:

- latency
- answer grounding/citations
- implementation effort
- security/compliance fit
- operational cost control
- maintainability

### Step 6: Write a recommendation memo
In 1 page, answer:

- Which use cases should move to Work IQ first?
- Which should remain on custom Graph-based integrations?
- What risks or unknowns need validation in a pilot?

### Optional technical artifact
Draft pseudocode for a Work IQ-first orchestration:

```python
user_request = "Prepare me for my 2 PM customer meeting"

context = workiq.context.get(
    query=user_request,
    sources=["email", "calendar", "meetings", "chat", "files"]
)

briefing = workiq.chat.respond(
    prompt=user_request,
    context=context,
    citations=True
)

workspace_id = workiq.workspaces.save(
    task="customer_meeting_prep",
    state={"briefing": briefing}
)

# Optional follow-up action
workiq.tools.invoke(
    tool="schedule_followup",
    params={"workspace_id": workspace_id}
)
```

Even if you do not have API access, this exercise forces you to reason about architecture boundaries, orchestration simplification, and governance advantages.
