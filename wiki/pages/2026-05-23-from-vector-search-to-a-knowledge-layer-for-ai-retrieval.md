## Overview

This lesson explains the shift from treating vector search as the primary retrieval primitive to building a broader knowledge layer that combines embeddings, metadata, structure, and relationships. The source title suggests a critique of pure vector databases and a move toward more expressive retrieval systems for AI applications.

This matters to engineers building RAG systems, agent memory, enterprise search, or AI copilots. As applications mature, semantic similarity alone is often not enough: teams need better grounding, filtering, relationship traversal, provenance, and support for complex queries across heterogeneous data.

## Key Concepts

- **Vector search**: Vector search represents documents or chunks as embeddings and retrieves nearest neighbors to a query embedding. It is powerful for semantic similarity, but by itself it often struggles with exact constraints, multi-hop relationships, and explicit business logic.
- **Knowledge layer**: A knowledge layer sits above raw storage and exposes information in a form that AI systems can retrieve more reliably. It typically combines vectors, metadata, document structure, entity relationships, and retrieval policies into a unified access pattern.
- **Hybrid retrieval**: Hybrid retrieval blends semantic search with lexical search, metadata filtering, and sometimes graph traversal. This improves recall and precision, especially for queries containing proper nouns, numbers, dates, or domain-specific terminology.
- **Structured context**: Structured context means preserving the organization of information rather than flattening everything into independent chunks. Examples include sections, citations, entities, tables, source documents, and links between records.
- **Retrieval orchestration**: Retrieval orchestration is the logic that decides how to answer a query: which indexes to hit, what filters to apply, how to rerank, and how to assemble final context. It turns retrieval into a pipeline rather than a single nearest-neighbor lookup.
- **Grounding and provenance**: Grounding ensures generated answers are tied to real source material, while provenance preserves where each fact came from. These are essential for trust, debugging, compliance, and reducing hallucinations in production AI systems.

## How It Works

The central idea is that vector search is becoming one component of a larger retrieval architecture rather than the whole architecture. Early RAG systems often worked like this:

1. Chunk documents.
2. Embed each chunk.
3. Store vectors in a vector database.
4. Embed the user query.
5. Fetch the top-k nearest chunks.
6. Send those chunks to the LLM.

That pattern is still useful, but it breaks down when the application needs more than semantic similarity. Typical failure modes include:

- missing exact identifiers like SKU numbers or legal clause references
- retrieving chunks that are semantically close but contextually wrong
- losing document hierarchy and section boundaries during chunking
- inability to answer questions that require traversing relationships between entities
- poor filtering across access control, timestamps, tenants, or document types

A knowledge layer addresses these gaps by treating data as a connected, queryable system instead of a bag of chunks. In practice, that often means storing and retrieving multiple kinds of information together:

- **Embeddings** for semantic similarity
- **Keywords / sparse indexes** for exact-match retrieval
- **Metadata** such as author, timestamp, product, customer, or permissions
- **Document structure** such as title, section, paragraph, table, and citation boundaries
- **Entities and relationships** such as person -> company, incident -> service, API -> endpoint
- **Policies** for ranking, filtering, freshness, and source trust

A typical query flow in a knowledge-layer design looks like this:

1. **Interpret the query**
   - Detect whether it needs semantic matching, exact matching, filters, or relationship traversal.
   - Extract entities, dates, or constraints.

2. **Route retrieval**
   - Run vector search for conceptual similarity.
   - Run keyword or BM25-style search for exact terms.
   - Apply metadata filters such as tenant, recency, or access control.
   - Optionally traverse graph-like relationships to gather linked facts.

3. **Merge and rerank results**
   - Combine candidates from different retrieval methods.
   - Rerank using a cross-encoder or an LLM-aware scorer.
   - Prefer chunks with stronger provenance, freshness, or structural relevance.

4. **Assemble context**
   - Expand a chunk to its surrounding section or source document region.
   - Attach citations, entity summaries, or related records.
   - Deduplicate overlapping evidence.

5. **Generate answer with citations**
   - Feed curated context to the LLM.
   - Preserve source references for each claim.

This is why a knowledge layer can be seen as "demoting" vector search: vectors remain valuable, but they are no longer the sole retrieval abstraction. Instead, they become one index among several.

A practical architecture for this often includes the following components:

- **Ingestion pipeline**
  - parses raw documents
  - extracts text, metadata, and structure
  - performs chunking with section awareness
  - computes embeddings
  - optionally extracts entities and links

- **Storage layer**
  - vector index for embeddings
  - search index for lexical retrieval
  - relational/document store for metadata and source records
  - graph or relationship store when entity traversal matters

- **Retrieval service**
  - query analysis
  - index routing
  - filtering and policy enforcement
  - reranking
  - context assembly

- **Generation layer**
  - prompt construction
  - answer synthesis
  - citation formatting
  - feedback logging for evaluation

Here is a simplified pseudocode sketch:

```python
def retrieve(query, user_context):
    parsed = analyze_query(query)

    semantic_hits = vector_index.search(
        embed(query),
        top_k=20,
        filter={"tenant": user_context.tenant_id}
    )

    lexical_hits = keyword_index.search(
        query,
        top_k=20,
        filter={"tenant": user_context.tenant_id}
    )

    graph_hits = []
    if parsed.entities:
        graph_hits = graph_store.expand(parsed.entities, hops=1)

    candidates = merge(semantic_hits, lexical_hits, graph_hits)
    ranked = rerank(query, candidates)
    context = assemble_context(ranked[:8])
    return context
```

The engineering implication is important: retrieval quality increasingly depends on modeling knowledge explicitly. If your system only stores detached chunks and embeddings, you are throwing away information that may be essential for accurate answers. A knowledge layer preserves that information and makes it operational.

When should you adopt this approach?

- If users ask questions with strict filters or exact identifiers
- If answers must include citations and traceability
- If data contains rich relationships across entities or systems
- If you need multi-source retrieval across docs, tickets, tables, and APIs
- If production quality matters more than demo simplicity

When is pure vector search still enough?

- Small corpora
- Low-risk semantic Q&A
- Prototyping and experimentation
- Applications where document similarity is the main objective rather than precise grounded reasoning

## Training Exercise

Build a small hybrid knowledge-layer prototype on top of a document set you already have, such as engineering docs, runbooks, or product specs.

### Goal
Compare pure vector retrieval with a simple knowledge-layer pipeline that adds lexical search, metadata filters, and context assembly.

### Step 1: Prepare a tiny corpus
Create 10-20 text documents with metadata. For each document, include fields like:

- `id`
- `title`
- `text`
- `team`
- `created_at`
- `tags`

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "id": "doc-001",
  "title": "Payment service incident review",
  "text": "On 2026-02-01 the payment API returned 503 errors due to database connection exhaustion...",
  "team": "payments",
  "created_at": "2026-02-01",
  "tags": ["incident", "api", "database"]
}
```

### Step 2: Implement two retrieval paths
Create:

1. A semantic search path using embeddings and cosine similarity.
2. A lexical path using keyword matching or BM25.

If you do not want to use external services, start with a mock lexical scorer and a local embedding model.

### Step 3: Add metadata filtering
Before ranking final results, enforce at least one filter such as:

- only documents from a given team
- only recent documents
- only documents with a matching tag

### Step 4: Merge and rerank
Combine results from both retrieval paths. A simple approach is reciprocal rank fusion or weighted score normalization.

Pseudo-implementation:

```python
def hybrid_search(query, team=None):
    semantic = semantic_search(query, top_k=10)
    lexical = lexical_search(query, top_k=10)
    merged = fuse_results(semantic, lexical)

    if team:
        merged = [r for r in merged if r["team"] == team]

    return merged[:5]
```

### Step 5: Assemble better context
Instead of returning a single chunk, return:

- the chunk
- its title
- adjacent text or section summary
- metadata for citation

### Step 6: Evaluate
Write 8-10 test queries, including:

- a semantic query: "Why did the payment service fail?"
- an exact query: "Which incident mentions 503 errors?"
- a filtered query: "Recent payments incidents about database issues"

For each query, compare:

- vector-only results
- hybrid knowledge-layer results

Record where vector-only misses exact terms, ignores filters, or returns weaker evidence.

### Step 7: Stretch goal
Add lightweight entity extraction. For example, detect service names, error codes, and dates, then store them separately. Route some queries through entity-aware retrieval first.

### Success criteria
By the end, you should be able to explain with evidence:

- where vector search works well
- where it fails
- how additional structure improves retrieval quality
- what parts of a full knowledge layer are worth implementing in your own stack
