## Overview

This lesson teaches how to use Kimi K3 from the Kimi API Platform quickstart page. The source presents Kimi K3 as a flagship 2.8-trillion-parameter model with native visual understanding, a 1M-token context window, always-on reasoning, and OpenAI SDK compatibility through `base_url="https://api.moonshot.ai/v1"`. Practically, the page is most useful as an API integration guide: authenticate with `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`, send chat completion requests, control `reasoning_effort`, stream reasoning and answer deltas, pass image/video inputs in the required message format, enforce JSON output with `json_schema`, and run tool-calling loops correctly by preserving the full assistant message. Some broader claims, such as being the first open-source model in its class or having roughly 2.5x K2 scaling efficiency, are stated by the source but not independently substantiated within it.

## Key Concepts

- **OpenAI SDK compatibility via custom base URL**: The examples use the Python `openai` package with `OpenAI(api_key=os.environ["MOONSHOT_API_KEY"], base_url="https://api.moonshot.ai/v1")`. The key practical point is that you keep the SDK interface but target Kimi's API endpoint.
- **Always-on reasoning with configurable effort**: Kimi K3 always runs in thinking mode. You cannot disable chain-of-thought behavior, but you can adjust the top-level `reasoning_effort` field to `low`, `high`, or `max` to trade off depth and latency; the source says the default is `max`.
- **Message integrity in multi-turn and tool workflows**: The source repeatedly warns to carry forward the complete assistant message returned by the API, not just `message.content`. This matters because tool calls and other metadata live on the assistant message object.
- **Streaming separates reasoning from final answer**: When streaming, deltas may contain `reasoning_content` and `content` separately. A client should handle both streams distinctly and avoid parsing intermediate reasoning as the final structured result.
- **Multimodal input requires structured content arrays**: For vision, `content` must be an array of typed objects such as text, `image_url`, or `video_url`, not a serialized string. Public image URLs are not supported according to the page; examples use base64 data URLs for images and `ms://<file-id>` for uploaded video.
- **Structured output uses strict JSON Schema**: To constrain the final answer, the quickstart uses `response_format={"type":"json_schema", ...}` with `strict: true`. The source explicitly says to parse only `message.content`, not `reasoning_content`.
- **Tool calling is explicit and stateful**: You can require at least one tool call with `tool_choice="required"`, execute each returned call yourself, append matching tool messages with `tool_call_id`, and call the model again. The page also shows dynamic tool loading by placing tool definitions in a `system` message.
- **Large-context usage benefits from stable prefixes**: The source says K3 has a 1M-token context window and automatic context caching. Cache eligibility depends on a previous request having more than 256 prompt tokens, and later requests should keep the long prefix unchanged to attempt cache hits.

## How It Works

A minimal working flow is: install `openai>=1.0`, set `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`, create an `OpenAI` client pointed at `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1`, and call `client.chat.completions.create(model="kimi-k3", messages=[...])`. From there, choose the advanced behavior you need. For deeper reasoning, set `reasoning_effort`. For streaming, read both `delta.reasoning_content` and `delta.content`. For vision, build `messages` so `content` is an array of typed parts and use base64 or uploaded-file references instead of public URLs. For JSON extraction, provide a strict `json_schema` and parse only the final `message.content`. For tool use, preserve the entire assistant message, execute every returned tool call, append corresponding tool results, and request the final answer in a second round. For long documents or knowledge bases, keep a stable long prefix so automatic caching can potentially help on later requests. Also note the documented limits: several sampling parameters are fixed and should be omitted, `max_completion_tokens` defaults to 131072 and can be raised to 1048576, and web search is described as not recommended for production workflows in the near term.

## Training Exercise

Build a small Python script that does three things with the same `client`: first, asks Kimi K3 for a one-sentence summary of a local markdown file inserted as a system prompt; second, extracts two fields from a sentence using strict `json_schema`; third, runs a single required tool call using a toy function like `get_weather`. Success criteria: you preserve the complete assistant message during the tool loop, parse structured data only from `message.content`, and keep the long markdown prefix unchanged between two related summarization questions so your code is compatible with the source's caching guidance.
