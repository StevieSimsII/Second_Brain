## Overview

This lesson is about how to evaluate two classes of AI understanding tools in a practical SaaS context: tools that try to deeply explain a product or codebase, and tools that convert information into graph-like connected entities and relationships. The source only provides the video title, but that title alone points to a common engineering problem: deciding whether an AI system should optimize for human-readable understanding or structured knowledge extraction.

Engineers, product builders, and technical founders care about this because the choice affects onboarding, debugging, documentation, support automation, and internal search. A good evaluation framework helps you move beyond marketing claims and compare tools based on what they actually produce, how they ingest your SaaS artifacts, and whether the outputs are useful for real workflows.

## Key Concepts

- **Knowledge understanding tool**: A knowledge understanding tool focuses on generating coherent explanations from source material such as documentation, code, or product pages. Its value is usually measured by how quickly a human can grasp the system, identify components, and answer practical questions.
- **Knowledge graph extraction**: Knowledge graph extraction turns source content into nodes and relationships, such as features, entities, workflows, APIs, and dependencies. This structured representation is useful for search, recommendations, retrieval, and reasoning across connected concepts.
- **SaaS artifact ingestion**: Any AI analysis system depends on what inputs it can ingest: landing pages, help docs, API references, code repositories, support tickets, and database schemas. The breadth and quality of ingestion strongly determine whether the tool captures the actual product instead of a shallow marketing summary.
- **Evaluation criteria**: Tool comparison should be grounded in criteria such as accuracy, completeness, explainability, freshness, output format, and integration effort. Without explicit criteria, it's easy to prefer a demo that looks polished but is not operationally useful.
- **Human-readable vs machine-readable output**: Some tools optimize for narrative summaries that help engineers and stakeholders understand a system quickly. Others optimize for structured outputs like graphs, entities, and relations that can feed downstream automation and retrieval pipelines.
- **Workflow fit**: A tool is only valuable if it fits into a real engineering or product workflow. For example, a graphing tool may help semantic search and support routing, while an understanding tool may be better for onboarding and architecture reviews.

## How It Works

When comparing a tool like "Understand-Anything" against one like "Graphify," the most useful mental model is to treat them as solving adjacent but different problems.

A product in the first category generally tries to answer: **"What is this SaaS, how does it work, and how can a human quickly understand it?"** It likely consumes a website, docs, or code-related context and produces summaries, explanations, concept breakdowns, and possibly Q&A. The best version of this kind of tool preserves technical detail while compressing complexity.

A product in the second category generally tries to answer: **"What are the entities in this SaaS, and how are they connected?"** Instead of primarily producing prose, it may generate a graph of pages, features, data objects, users, workflows, integrations, or concepts. That structured layer can be better for search, recommendation, and relationship discovery.

A practical evaluation for your SaaS should be built around the artifacts the tools can actually analyze:

- Public marketing site
- Documentation and help center
- API reference
- Product UI flows
- Source code or repository metadata
- Database or domain model descriptions
- Support content and FAQs

Then evaluate the outputs across four dimensions:

1. **Coverage**
   - Did the tool identify the major product areas?
   - Did it understand pricing, features, workflows, and technical constraints?
   - Did it miss important hidden complexity, such as multi-tenant behavior or integration-specific logic?

2. **Correctness**
   - Are the generated explanations accurate?
   - Are relationships in the graph real, or are they inferred too aggressively?
   - Does the tool hallucinate unsupported features or architecture details?

3. **Utility**
   - Can a new engineer use the output to onboard faster?
   - Can support or sales use it to answer product questions?
   - Can the structured output support retrieval, navigation, or automation?

4. **Operational fit**
   - How long does ingestion take?
   - Can it refresh as docs and features change?
   - Is the output exportable through an API or limited to a UI?

In practice, the data flow for these tools often looks like this:

```text
SaaS artifacts
  -> crawler / importer
  -> content normalization
  -> chunking or entity extraction
  -> LLM or extraction pipeline
  -> output layer
     - narrative summaries / Q&A
     - graph nodes and edges
     - search or navigation UI
```

The main difference is in the middle and final stages:

- An **understanding-oriented** tool emphasizes semantic compression and explanation.
- A **graph-oriented** tool emphasizes entity resolution, relationship extraction, and traversal.

This means each tool can fail differently:

- Understanding tools may produce readable but overly generalized summaries.
- Graph tools may produce precise-looking structures that are incomplete, noisy, or hard for humans to interpret.

If you are testing both on a SaaS, the key is to design evaluation questions that expose those tradeoffs. Examples:

- "What are the core user workflows in this product?"
- "How does billing relate to organizations, seats, and usage?"
- "Which integrations affect authentication or data sync?"
- "What parts of the API are tied to reporting features?"
- "How would a support engineer find all content related to failed imports?"

A useful outcome from such a comparison is not necessarily choosing one winner. You may discover that:

- narrative understanding is better for onboarding and stakeholder communication,
- graph extraction is better for semantic search and internal knowledge tooling,
- or the best architecture combines both, using extracted graph structure as a backbone and generated explanations as a presentation layer.

Because the source content does not include the actual video transcript, claims about the specific products must remain generic. But the video title strongly suggests a hands-on comparison, and the most valuable lesson from that type of content is the evaluation framework: compare tools based on what they ingest, what they output, how accurate they are on your SaaS, and whether those outputs improve a real workflow.

## Training Exercise

Build a lightweight evaluation matrix for two AI analysis tools using your own SaaS, side project, or a public product.

### Goal
Determine whether a tool is better at human understanding, graph extraction, or both.

### Step 1: Pick a target system
Choose one of the following:

- Your SaaS product
- An internal developer platform
- A public SaaS with rich docs, such as Stripe, Supabase, or Vercel

### Step 2: Gather source artifacts
Collect at least three inputs:

- Home or product page
- Documentation page
- API or integration page

Store the URLs in a simple text file.

```text
https://example.com
https://docs.example.com/getting-started
https://docs.example.com/api
```

### Step 3: Define evaluation questions
Create 8-10 questions that a real engineer or support person would ask. For example:

- What are the main product capabilities?
- What user roles exist?
- What integrations are supported?
- What are the primary API resources?
- What failure modes are documented?

### Step 4: Score each tool
For each tool, capture:

- Summary quality
- Entity/relationship quality
- Missing concepts
- Hallucinations
- Ease of use
- Export/integration options

Use a 1-5 scoring table like this:

```text
Criterion              Tool A   Tool B   Notes
coverage               4        3        Tool B missed billing concepts
accuracy               3        4        Tool A invented one integration
human readability      5        2        Tool A much easier to consume
graph usefulness       2        5        Tool B excellent relationship view
refresh/update model   3        3        Similar limitations
```

### Step 5: Create a combined recommendation
Write a short decision memo with this structure:

1. Best for onboarding
2. Best for search/retrieval
3. Biggest failure observed
4. Whether to adopt one tool, both, or neither

### Optional stretch exercise
Implement a tiny graph extraction prototype yourself from documentation text. Use an LLM or manual extraction to produce triples:

```json
[
  {"source": "Organization", "relation": "contains", "target": "Projects"},
  {"source": "Project", "relation": "uses", "target": "API Key"},
  {"source": "Import Job", "relation": "can_fail_with", "target": "Validation Error"}
]
```

Then compare this structured view to a plain natural-language summary and note which one better answers different classes of questions.
