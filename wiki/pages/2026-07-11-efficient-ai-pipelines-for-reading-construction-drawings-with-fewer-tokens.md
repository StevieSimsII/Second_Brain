## Overview

This lesson explains a practical pattern for getting AI systems to interpret construction drawings more accurately while dramatically reducing token usage. The core idea is to avoid sending entire large-format plan sheets directly into a multimodal model and instead build a staged pipeline that extracts structure first: detect relevant regions, recover text and geometry, and send only compact, task-specific context to an LLM.

This matters for engineers building systems around architectural, engineering, and construction documents, where drawings are visually dense, noisy, and expensive to process end-to-end with frontier models. The approach is useful for teams working on plan review, quantity takeoff, compliance checks, field tooling, and document search, especially when cost, latency, and reliability matter.

## Key Concepts

- **Token-efficient document understanding**: Large construction drawings contain far more visual detail than most downstream tasks require. A token-efficient system reduces the input to only the relevant text, symbols, regions, and relationships, which lowers cost and often improves accuracy by removing distracting context.
- **Region-first parsing**: Instead of asking a model to understand an entire sheet at once, the pipeline first identifies meaningful zones such as title blocks, legends, callouts, schedules, and detail references. This decomposition creates smaller, semantically coherent units that are easier to process and validate.
- **Hybrid OCR and vision extraction**: Construction drawings combine typed text, linework, symbols, tables, and spatial layout. A robust pipeline usually combines OCR for text, image processing or detection models for graphics and tables, and layout logic to preserve the relationships between extracted elements.
- **Structured intermediate representations**: Raw image pixels are a poor interface for business logic. Converting a sheet into structured data such as bounding boxes, recognized labels, table rows, and graph-like links between references enables deterministic post-processing and better prompts to LLMs.
- **Task-specific context packing**: Different questions need different subsets of the drawing. For example, answering a question about door schedules should include only the schedule table, related room tags, and legend definitions rather than the whole sheet, which reduces prompt size and ambiguity.
- **Accuracy through decomposition**: Breaking the problem into extraction, normalization, retrieval, and reasoning stages makes each step easier to evaluate and improve. This often yields higher end accuracy than a single monolithic model call because failures become localized and measurable.

## How It Works

A practical AI system for construction drawings typically follows a multi-stage pipeline rather than a single end-to-end prompt.

First, ingest the drawing in a format suitable for analysis. Many plans originate as vector PDFs, raster exports, or scanned sheets. The system should normalize page dimensions, DPI, rotation, and coordinate systems so later stages can reason about locations consistently. If vector PDF content is available, text objects and line primitives can sometimes be extracted directly, which is cheaper and cleaner than pure OCR.

Second, segment the sheet into meaningful regions. Construction sheets are structured documents: title blocks, revision tables, legends, schedules, keyed notes, plans, elevations, and details usually occupy predictable areas. Region detection can be implemented with classic heuristics, learned layout models, or a hybrid approach. The point is to isolate content types before asking a language model to reason over them.

Third, extract content from each region using the right tool:

- **OCR** for notes, dimensions, and callouts
- **Table extraction** for schedules and legends
- **Symbol or object detection** for annotations, markers, and graphical references
- **Vector parsing** when the source PDF preserves text and geometry

At this stage, preserve coordinates. A note without its location is much less useful because drawing meaning is heavily spatial. For example, a room label, detail bubble, or keynote number usually matters because of where it appears.

Fourth, build a structured intermediate representation. This can be a JSON document containing:

```json
{
  "sheet_id": "A101",
  "regions": [
    {"type": "title_block", "bbox": [0, 0, 300, 1200]},
    {"type": "schedule", "bbox": [3100, 200, 3900, 1400]}
  ],
  "texts": [
    {"text": "DOOR SCHEDULE", "bbox": [3120, 220, 3400, 280]},
    {"text": "101A", "bbox": [1500, 900, 1580, 940]}
  ],
  "links": [
    {"from": "detail_marker_12", "to": "sheet_A501_detail_3"}
  ]
}
```

This representation is the key to reducing token usage. Instead of sending a full-resolution image or every OCR fragment, the system can retrieve only the subset needed for a user task.

Fifth, perform task-specific retrieval and prompt construction. Suppose the user asks, "What fire rating is required for doors on level 1?" The system should not attach the whole sheet set. It should gather:

- door schedule rows
- legend entries related to fire ratings
- notes or code references near level 1 doors
- possibly linked sheets or detail references

Then it can create a compact prompt containing only normalized, structured evidence. This is where the token savings come from: the LLM sees curated facts, not an entire noisy drawing.

Sixth, run reasoning and optionally verification. The language model can synthesize answers, but the system should retain provenance. Each answer should be traceable back to sheet IDs, region boxes, and extracted rows or notes. In production, it is often worth adding validation rules such as schema checks, confidence thresholds, and cross-sheet consistency tests.

A useful mental model is:

1. **See** the drawing
2. **Split** it into regions
3. **Extract** text and structure
4. **Retrieve** only relevant evidence
5. **Reason** over the compact evidence set
6. **Cite** the source locations

Why this can improve accuracy by around 20% in practice:

- Whole-sheet prompting includes irrelevant clutter, which increases confusion.
- OCR and layout extraction can make the text more explicit than a multimodal model reading tiny rasterized print.
- Task-specific prompts reduce the chance that the model latches onto the wrong note or schedule.
- Structured retrieval lets you include linked context from other sheets without overloading the prompt.

The main engineering tradeoff is complexity. A staged pipeline requires more components than direct image prompting, but it gives better control over cost, observability, and failure analysis. For construction workflows, that tradeoff is often worth it because the documents are large, repetitive, and operationally important.

## Training Exercise

Build a minimal pipeline that answers one targeted question from a construction drawing using extracted structure instead of a full-image prompt.

### Goal
Given a plan sheet PDF or image, answer: **"What sheet number and drawing title does this document have?"** Then extend it to answer: **"What notes appear in the legend area?"**

### Step 1: Collect a sample drawing
Use any publicly available architectural or engineering sheet in PDF form.

### Step 2: Render the first page
Use a PDF renderer to create a high-resolution PNG.

Example with Python:

```python
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
pages = convert_from_path("sample_drawing.pdf", dpi=200)
pages[0].save("sheet.png", "PNG")
```

### Step 3: Run OCR with bounding boxes
Use Tesseract, PaddleOCR, or a cloud OCR service to extract text plus coordinates.

Expected output shape:

```python
ocr_items = [
    {"text": "A101", "bbox": [3200, 2100, 3350, 2160]},
    {"text": "FIRST FLOOR PLAN", "bbox": [2800, 2170, 3600, 2230]}
]
```

### Step 4: Define simple region heuristics
Implement two rough regions:

1. **Title block** = bottom-right 25% of the sheet
2. **Legend area** = top-right 25% of the sheet

Filter OCR items whose bounding boxes fall inside each region.

### Step 5: Build a compact JSON context
Create a small structure like:

```json
{
  "title_block_text": ["A101", "FIRST FLOOR PLAN", "SCALE: 1/8\" = 1'-0\""] ,
  "legend_text": ["WALL TYPES", "1 HR RATED", "2 HR RATED"]
}
```

### Step 6: Ask an LLM using only the compact context
Prompt the model with the JSON instead of the full image:

- Extract the likely sheet number
- Extract the likely drawing title
- Summarize legend notes

### Step 7: Compare against a naive baseline
Try a baseline where you send the full image to a multimodal model and ask the same questions. Compare:

- response quality
- latency
- token or image-processing cost
- ease of verifying the answer

### Step 8: Extend the exercise
Improve the regioning logic by detecting table-like areas or title-block borders. If you have multiple sheets, add retrieval so that a user question first selects the relevant sheet before forming the final prompt.

### Success criteria
You should end with a small script that:

1. extracts OCR text with coordinates,
2. selects a region of interest,
3. constructs a compact prompt payload, and
4. answers a targeted question more cheaply than using the entire drawing directly.
