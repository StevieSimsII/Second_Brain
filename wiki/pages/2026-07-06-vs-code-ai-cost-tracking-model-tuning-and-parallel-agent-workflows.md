## Overview

This release update highlights a shift in how AI-assisted development is managed inside Visual Studio Code: developers are being given better visibility into cost, more direct control over model behavior, and improved ways to explore multiple ideas in parallel. The key additions are chat session cost tracking, a unified model customization picker for selecting context size and reasoning effort, a preview Agents window for side conversations, and safer repository exploration with Restricted Mode enabled by default.

For working engineers, these changes matter because AI coding tools are moving from novelty to operational tooling. Once AI usage becomes part of day-to-day development, teams need to balance answer quality, latency, and token spend. This release is notable because it treats those tradeoffs as first-class concerns in the editor rather than hidden implementation details.

## Key Concepts

- **Chat session cost tracking**: VS Code can now surface the total cost associated with a chat session. This gives developers direct feedback about how much AI assistance is costing over time, which is essential when prompts, code context, and iterative debugging can rapidly increase token usage.
- **Unified model customization picker**: The model customization picker centralizes model-related controls such as context size and reasoning effort. Instead of treating model selection as a static choice, VS Code exposes the practical knobs that affect quality, speed, and spend.
- **Context size tradeoff**: Context size determines how much code, history, and prompt material is sent to the model. Larger context windows can improve relevance on complex tasks, but they also increase token consumption and may raise cost significantly.
- **Reasoning effort control**: Reasoning effort is an abstraction for how much internal work a model performs before returning an answer. Higher effort may improve planning and correctness for difficult tasks, but usually increases latency and usage cost.
- **Parallel agent conversations**: The preview Agents window introduces side conversations so developers can explore multiple approaches at the same time. This is useful for comparing refactor strategies, debugging hypotheses, or architecture options without losing the main thread.
- **Restricted Mode by default**: Restricted Mode limits workspace features when opening untrusted repositories. Making it the default for new repo exploration reduces the risk of automatically executing unsafe code or enabling extensions in untrusted environments.

## How It Works

The core idea behind this release is that AI assistance in the editor should be observable and tunable, not opaque. Historically, developers interacted with coding assistants mainly through prompts and responses, with little feedback about cost or the effect of changing model settings. This update adds operational visibility directly into the workflow.

At a high level, the release introduces three connected control surfaces:

1. **Usage visibility** via per-session chat cost tracking.
2. **Behavior tuning** via a unified picker for model customization.
3. **Workflow branching** via the Agents window for side conversations.

These features work together because model configuration influences token usage, and token usage influences cost. The session cost view closes the loop by showing the practical impact of your choices.

A typical flow looks like this:

- You start an AI chat or coding task inside VS Code.
- VS Code sends your prompt plus attached context, such as selected files, editor content, or conversation history, to the configured model provider.
- The model configuration determines factors like context size and reasoning effort.
- As the session progresses, VS Code accumulates usage data and surfaces the total session cost.
- If the task branches into multiple possibilities, you can open side conversations in the Agents window rather than overloading one long chat thread.

This matters because **token economics** are strongly affected by editor behavior:

- Longer conversations increase prompt history size.
- Broader file context increases input tokens.
- More reasoning-heavy settings may increase processing overhead.
- Repeated retries, debugging loops, and code regeneration can compound spend quickly.

The **unified model customization picker** is the release's key usability improvement. Instead of forcing developers to think only in terms of provider or model name, VS Code groups together the settings that actually matter in practice:

- **Context size**: how much code and conversation state is available to the model.
- **Reasoning effort**: how much work the model should spend on the task.
- Potentially the underlying model choice itself, depending on provider integration.

This is effectively a performance/cost dashboard in miniature. For example:

- Use **smaller context + lower reasoning** for quick syntax help or boilerplate generation.
- Use **larger context + higher reasoning** for multi-file refactors, root-cause analysis, or architecture-heavy questions.

The **Agents window (Preview)** introduces a more scalable way to work with AI during development. Rather than forcing all exploration into a single linear conversation, it allows side conversations for parallel thinking. In practice, that means you can:

- Keep one thread focused on debugging a failing test.
- Open another thread to propose a refactor.
- Open a third to compare two library choices.

This reduces context pollution. A single giant conversation often becomes expensive and semantically noisy, because unrelated exploration remains in the prompt history. Parallel threads can improve both clarity and cost control by isolating tasks.

The **Restricted Mode on by default** update is not directly about AI, but it is important in the same workflow. AI-assisted coding often begins with opening unfamiliar repositories to inspect, explain, or modify them. Restricted Mode reduces risk during that exploration phase by preventing trusted execution features from enabling automatically.

Taken together, the release suggests a broader pattern: AI in the IDE is becoming an engineering system with measurable operational characteristics. Developers are no longer just asking for completions; they are managing:

- quality,
- latency,
- context scope,
- branching workflows, and
- cost.

That is why cost tracking and model tuning are important. They let engineers treat AI assistance like any other resource in the toolchain: something to optimize based on workload, constraints, and risk.

## Training Exercise

Use VS Code's AI chat features to measure how model settings affect result quality and spend.

### Goal
Learn how context size, reasoning effort, and conversation structure change the cost and usefulness of AI assistance.

### Prerequisites
- A recent version of Visual Studio Code
- Access to the built-in AI chat or a supported chat-enabled setup in VS Code
- A small code repository with at least 3-5 files

### Steps
1. **Open a sample project**
   - Choose a repo you understand moderately well, such as a small API service or frontend app.
   - If prompted for trust, note whether VS Code opens in Restricted Mode.

2. **Pick a simple task**
   - Example: "Explain how routing works in this project."
   - Run it with a conservative configuration: smaller context and lower reasoning effort.
   - Record the response quality and the reported session cost.

3. **Repeat with a larger context**
   - Ask a broader question: "Trace the full request flow from route handler to database call."
   - Increase the context size in the model customization picker.
   - Compare whether the answer becomes more accurate or complete, and note the cost difference.

4. **Repeat with higher reasoning effort**
   - Ask a more analytical question: "Suggest the most likely cause of duplicate writes and how to verify it."
   - Increase reasoning effort while keeping the task similar.
   - Record latency, answer depth, and total cost.

5. **Create side conversations in the Agents window**
   - Main conversation: debug a bug report.
   - Side conversation A: propose a minimal patch.
   - Side conversation B: propose a refactor to prevent recurrence.
   - Observe whether separate threads produce cleaner, more focused results than one mixed conversation.

6. **Summarize your findings**
   - Create a short table like this in your notes:

```text
Task | Context Size | Reasoning Effort | Quality Notes | Session Cost
Explain routing | Small | Low | Fast, somewhat shallow | ...
Trace request flow | Large | Low | Better cross-file accuracy | ...
Debug duplicate writes | Large | High | More detailed reasoning | ...
```

### Stretch exercise
Define a team guideline for when to use each setting level. For example:

- Low cost mode for boilerplate, docs, and simple fixes
- Medium mode for single-file debugging
- High context/high reasoning only for multi-file analysis or architecture decisions

This turns the release features into an operational playbook rather than an ad hoc preference.
