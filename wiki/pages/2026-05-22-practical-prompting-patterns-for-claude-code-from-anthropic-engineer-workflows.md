## Overview

This lesson distills practical prompting techniques for Claude Code based on the theme of how Anthropic engineers actually work with code-focused LLMs. Even though the source page provides minimal transcript detail, the core topic strongly suggests a real-world workflow centered on giving the model better context, clearer constraints, and structured tasks so it can act like a reliable engineering assistant rather than a generic chatbot.

This matters for engineers who use AI for implementation, debugging, refactoring, and codebase exploration. The difference between a weak prompt and a strong one is often the difference between toy output and production-useful results. A disciplined prompting style helps reduce hallucinations, improve iteration speed, and make the model's output easier to review and trust.

## Key Concepts

- **Context packing**: Code models perform best when given the right local context: relevant files, interfaces, error messages, and constraints. Instead of asking broad questions, effective users gather the minimal but sufficient context needed for the model to reason accurately about the task.
- **Task decomposition**: Large coding requests should be split into smaller, verifiable steps such as understanding the problem, locating affected modules, proposing a plan, implementing a narrow change, and validating results. This reduces ambiguity and makes failures easier to detect and correct.
- **Explicit operating constraints**: A strong prompt tells the model what not to do as well as what to do: avoid changing public APIs, preserve tests, limit edits to certain files, or prefer minimal diffs. These constraints shape behavior and prevent the model from taking overly broad or risky actions.
- **Plan-then-execute prompting**: Before generating code, it is often useful to ask the model for a short plan, affected files, and tradeoffs. This gives the engineer a review checkpoint and improves output quality by forcing the model to reason before acting.
- **Verification loops**: Good prompting includes a built-in validation step: run tests, explain edge cases, compare before and after behavior, or generate a checklist for manual review. LLMs are more dependable when asked to verify rather than simply produce.
- **Prompt templates for recurring tasks**: Engineers benefit from reusable prompt patterns for debugging, refactoring, onboarding to a codebase, writing tests, or preparing a migration. Templates reduce cognitive overhead and make interactions more consistent across tasks and teams.

## How It Works

A practical Claude Code workflow usually starts with **grounding the model in the repository and task**. Rather than asking, "Fix this bug," an effective engineer supplies:

- the failing behavior
- the relevant stack trace or test failure
- the files likely involved
- constraints on scope
- what successful completion looks like

That turns an underspecified request into an engineering task the model can actually execute.

A common structure looks like this:

1. **Orient the model**
   - Describe the system or feature area.
   - Point to the relevant files or pasted code.
   - Explain the current behavior and desired behavior.

2. **Ask for a plan first**
   - Request a short diagnosis.
   - Ask which files need inspection or modification.
   - Require assumptions to be stated explicitly.

3. **Constrain the implementation**
   - Keep public interfaces unchanged.
   - Prefer minimal diffs.
   - Add or update tests.
   - Avoid unrelated cleanup.

4. **Require verification**
   - Ask what tests should pass.
   - Ask for edge cases.
   - Request a summary of risks and follow-up checks.

For example, a weak prompt might be:

```text
Fix the authentication bug.
```

A stronger version would be:

```text
We have a bug in our login flow: users with expired sessions sometimes get a 500 instead of being redirected to /login.

Relevant files:
- auth/middleware.ts
- api/session.ts
- tests/auth.test.ts

Constraints:
- Do not change the session cookie format.
- Keep the public API of api/session.ts unchanged.
- Prefer the smallest safe fix.
- Add or update tests.

First, explain the likely root cause and propose a minimal patch plan. Then implement the change and show the diff. Finally, list the tests you would run and any edge cases you considered.
```

This style works because it mirrors how experienced engineers delegate work: clear problem statement, known context, constraints, and acceptance criteria.

Another important mechanic is **iterative narrowing**. If the first answer is too broad or uncertain, do not restate the whole task from scratch. Instead, tighten one dimension at a time:

- ask it to focus on one file
- ask it to compare two possible root causes
- ask it to produce only tests first
- ask it to explain why a previous patch failed

This creates a feedback loop where the model gradually becomes more useful as it accumulates task-specific context.

For code generation, effective users often separate **reasoning artifacts** from **final outputs**. A useful flow is:

- ask for diagnosis
- ask for an implementation plan
- review the plan
- ask for the code change
- ask for test updates
- ask for a concise change summary

That makes the model easier to supervise, especially on nontrivial edits.

A related pattern is **use-case-specific prompting**:

- **Debugging:** Provide the error, reproduction steps, and recent changes. Ask for likely causes ranked by confidence.
- **Refactoring:** State the quality goal, scope boundary, and invariants that must remain true.
- **Codebase exploration:** Ask for the architecture of one feature, entry points, key abstractions, and where side effects happen.
- **Test generation:** Give the function or module and ask for high-value edge cases, not just happy-path tests.
- **Migration work:** Specify old and new APIs, rollout constraints, and what compatibility guarantees must hold.

In practice, the real skill is not writing one magical prompt. It is building a disciplined loop of:

- gather context
- scope the task
- ask for a plan
- constrain the output
- verify the result
- iterate on failures

That is likely the central lesson behind how experienced Claude Code users prompt: they treat the model like a fast junior engineer with broad knowledge but imperfect judgment, and they shape its work with context, constraints, and review checkpoints.

## Training Exercise

Build and use a reusable prompt template for a small coding task.

### Goal
Practice turning a vague coding request into a structured Claude Code workflow with planning, implementation, and verification.

### Step 1: Pick a small bug or feature
Use any local project, or create a simple one with a failing test. For example, create a small JavaScript function that mishandles empty input.

```js
// formatName.js
export function formatName(name) {
  return name.trim().toUpperCase();
}
```

This function will throw if `name` is `null` or `undefined`.

### Step 2: Write a weak prompt
Start with something intentionally underspecified:

```text
Fix formatName.
```

Note what is missing: no failure mode, no constraints, no file references, no test expectations.

### Step 3: Rewrite it as a strong engineering prompt
Use this template:

```text
Task: Fix a bug in `formatName.js`.

Current behavior:
- `formatName(name)` throws when `name` is null or undefined.

Desired behavior:
- Return an empty string for null, undefined, or all-whitespace input.
- Preserve current behavior for normal strings.

Relevant files:
- formatName.js
- formatName.test.js

Constraints:
- Keep the exported function name unchanged.
- Prefer the minimal safe code change.
- Add or update tests for edge cases.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.

First, explain the bug and propose a minimal fix plan.
Then provide the updated implementation and tests.
Finally, summarize edge cases covered and any remaining risks.
```

### Step 4: Evaluate the response
Check whether the model:

- identified the real failure mode
- kept the change small
- added tests for `null`, `undefined`, and whitespace input
- avoided unrelated edits

### Step 5: Add a verification prompt
After getting code back, ask:

```text
Review the patch critically. What edge cases might still fail? Are there any behavior changes for existing callers? Suggest 2 additional tests if needed.
```

### Step 6: Generalize into your own prompt library
Create 3 saved templates for recurring tasks:

1. Bug fixing
2. Refactoring
3. Test generation

For each template, include these sections:

- task
- current behavior
- desired behavior
- relevant files
- constraints
- requested output format
- verification requirements

### Success criteria
You should finish with:

- one weak prompt rewritten into a strong prompt
- one implemented fix with tests
- one follow-up verification pass
- three reusable prompt templates for future coding tasks
