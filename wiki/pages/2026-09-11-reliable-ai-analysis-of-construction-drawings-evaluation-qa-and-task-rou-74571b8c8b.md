## Overview

This lesson presents an evidence-driven method for improving AI analysis of construction drawings. The source reports tests involving more than 200 questions across 100 drawings from multiple disciplines. The strongest results came from building a discriminating evaluation set, correcting document-quality problems before analysis, and using short task-routed instructions instead of one large prompt. AI reportedly handled direct retrieval well but remained less reliable at counting, measurement, cross-sheet synthesis, and deciding when enough evidence had been gathered. These findings are preliminary: the described workflow remains under development, and most navigation tests used drawing packages containing fewer than roughly 40 drawings.

## Key Concepts

- **Evaluation before workflow design**: Create a representative question-and-answer set before optimizing prompts or skills. Include difficult tasks—such as counting, measurement, and cross-sheet reasoning—because easy text-retrieval questions may approach ceiling performance and fail to reveal meaningful differences.
- **Model and harness form one system**: Evaluate the model inside the environment where it will actually operate. In the source's tests, relative model performance changed when models were run through their respective coding-agent harnesses, showing that tools, navigation behavior, and execution context can materially affect results.
- **Two-phase drawing analysis**: Separate document preparation from querying. First run a drawing-pack QA pass covering filenames, contents, orientation, physical sheet size, stated scale, registers, revisions, and document precedence. Then run task-specific analysis against the validated package.
- **Minimal, task-routed instructions**: Keep the skill's entry instructions short and load specialized guidance only when needed—for example, separate guidance for text lookup, counting, measurement, and cross-sheet checks. The source reports that excessive or irrelevant instructions sometimes reduced accuracy on otherwise reliable tasks.
- **Retrieval is easier than interpretation**: The tested systems often located the correct sheet even when the final answer was wrong. Treat evidence discovery and evidence interpretation as separate stages, and verify calculations or conclusions rather than assuming that a correct citation guarantees a correct answer.
- **Construction-specific failure modes**: Recurring problems included counting legend symbols as installed items, missing dense or similar symbols, choosing the wrong measurement boundary, trusting mismatched scale and sheet-size metadata, stopping after the first plausible note, and missing text corrupted by spacing or PDF encoding.
- **Auditable answers and calibrated human review**: Human-facing answers should be concise but include sheet references, printed sheet labels, decisive notes, and useful screenshots. Agent-facing answers need structured values, confidence information, and an evidence trail. Known weak cases—especially dense counts—should explicitly trigger human review.
- **Incremental memory and scale-aware indexing**: Store verified answers in a lightweight drawing-memory file so later workflows can reuse them. The source found that advance indexing was often unnecessary for well-organized packages below about 40 drawings, but suggests indexing or retrieval infrastructure for packages containing hundreds of sheets; this larger-scale recommendation was not reported as fully tested.

## How It Works

Begin with a benchmark containing verified answers and score accuracy, token cost, and repeatability. Remove excessive easy questions and retain cases that expose real failure modes. When a revised drawing package arrives, run QA: confirm that filenames match contents, pages are correctly oriented, sheet dimensions agree with stated scales, drawing registers are accurate, revisions are coherent, and document precedence is recorded. Save only essential project-wide facts in a small drawing metadata file. During querying, let the model use its native search and rendering strategy while routing it to the smallest relevant instruction set. Use normalized or fuzzy text search when PDF text may contain irregular spacing. Require examination of several relevant evidence locations rather than accepting the first plausible result. For counts, distinguish legends and schedules from the actual count region and request screenshots when symbols are dense or ambiguous. For measurements, verify boundaries, scale, physical sheet size, and—where possible—the selected vector geometry. Return cited, inspectable evidence and record verified results in drawing memory. Re-run the benchmark after every instruction change because added guidance can improve one task while degrading another.

## Training Exercise

Build a miniature evaluation using 10–15 verified questions from one drawing package. Include three direct lookups, three counts, three measurements, and three questions requiring evidence from multiple sheets. First run the questions without special instructions and record accuracy, cost, repeatability, cited sheet, and failure category. Next perform a QA pass for filenames, orientation, sheet dimensions, scale, revisions, and register accuracy. Add only one targeted intervention per observed failure—for example, fuzzy search for spaced text, exclusion of legends from counts, or a requirement to inspect three relevant evidence locations. Run the same evaluation again. Finish by producing two example outputs: a concise human-facing answer with citations and screenshots, and a structured agent-facing answer containing the value, confidence, assumptions, and evidence trail. Do not claim improvement unless the repeated scores support it.
