## Overview
These notes explain why AI agents that can read and write Markdown may still fail when operating inside Obsidian. Obsidian uses product-specific conventions such as wikilinks, YAML frontmatter, typed properties, JSON Canvas files, and vault-specific organizational patterns. If an agent treats the vault as generic text, it can create changes that look valid but quietly break links, metadata-driven workflows, or structured views.

The key lesson is broader than Obsidian itself: structured tools often need explicit agent-facing rules or “skills” so models can act safely and correctly. For anyone building internal copilots, automation, or agent workflows around knowledge systems, this is a reminder that practical correctness depends on preserving the tool’s semantics, not just producing plausible text.

## Key Concepts
- **Tool-specific invariants**: Many tools embed assumptions that are not obvious from file extensions alone. In Obsidian, links, metadata, and visual canvases carry semantic meaning that an agent must preserve. A skill spec makes those invariants explicit so the agent can act like a knowledgeable user instead of treating everything as generic text.
- **Wikilinks and graph structure**: Obsidian commonly uses wikilinks like `[[Note Name]]` rather than standard Markdown links. These links are part of the vault’s navigational and graph structure, and incorrect formatting can break backlinking, note discovery, and relationship mapping. Agents need to generate and edit links using Obsidian conventions.
- **Frontmatter and typed metadata**: YAML frontmatter and typed properties in notes are not just decorative metadata; they are often used for filtering, querying, automation, and organization. If an agent writes metadata as free-form prose or omits required fields, downstream views and workflows can fail. Structured tools require structured writes.
- **Structured formats beyond Markdown**: Obsidian also supports formats such as JSON Canvas and Bases with typed properties and views. These formats have stricter schemas than plain note files, so an agent must understand how to create or modify them without corrupting their structure. This broadens the problem from text generation to schema-aware editing.
- **Agent skills as product interfaces**: A skill file or behavior spec acts like an interface contract between the tool and the agent. It defines acceptable syntax, data shapes, editing rules, and operational boundaries. This is similar to having an API contract, but for natural-language-driven automation.
- **Technically valid vs practically correct**: An agent can produce output that parses successfully yet is still wrong for the tool. For example, a note may remain readable Markdown while losing backlinks, required metadata, or queryable properties. Practical correctness means preserving the semantics the product depends on, not just file validity.

## How It Works
The central idea is that Obsidian should not be modeled as a directory of interchangeable Markdown files. It is better understood as a knowledge system with multiple data representations: note content, link semantics, metadata, structured databases or views, and visual canvases. A generic agent that only knows Markdown can create notes that look reasonable but violate hidden assumptions of the vault.

The proposed fix is a product-authored set of skills that tells AI agents how to operate inside an Obsidian vault. Instead of improvising, the agent is given explicit rules for:

- Obsidian Markdown syntax
- wikilinks and two-way linking behavior
- frontmatter and properties
- Bases support with typed fields, filters, and views
- JSON Canvas editing
- CLI-based vault operations
- web-to-Markdown cleanup via Defuddle

This shifts the workflow from “guess how the tool works” to “follow the official operating model.” That matters because many failures in document systems come from format drift: a model inserts a regular Markdown link where a wikilink is expected, flattens metadata into prose, or edits a JSON Canvas file without respecting schema constraints.

A useful mental model is a layered interaction process:

1. **Read using Obsidian semantics**
   - Treat `[[Page]]` and `[[Page|Alias]]` as first-class links.
   - Parse frontmatter as structured metadata, not plain text.
   - Detect specialized files such as canvases and database-like structures.

2. **Plan edits with schema awareness**
   - Include expected metadata when creating notes.
   - Use wikilinks consistently for internal references.
   - Preserve typed fields and JSON structure when editing Bases or canvases.

3. **Write conservatively**
   - Avoid rewriting unrelated content.
   - Preserve vault formatting conventions.
   - Maintain stable identifiers, names, and references.

4. **Prefer tool-native operations**
   - Use explicit file operations and validated transforms where possible.
   - Use cleanup and ingestion tools such as Defuddle for web content before inserting into the vault.

The broader architectural takeaway is that agent integration with structured systems should be treated as a contract-design problem. If the system has hidden semantics, the agent needs explicit behavioral guidance. Otherwise, the system may slowly degrade through “almost correct” edits that are hard to notice until links, views, queries, or automations stop working.

Overview

This lesson explains why generic AI agents often fail when interacting with tools like Obsidian, even if they can read and write Markdown. Obsidian is not just plain text files: it relies on conventions and structured formats such as wikilinks, YAML frontmatter, typed properties, JSON Canvas files, and vault-specific organization patterns. If an agent ignores those invariants, it can produce output that is syntactically valid but operationally harmful.

The source highlights an emerging pattern: software vendors shipping explicit “skills” or behavioral specs so agents can use their products correctly. For engineers building internal copilots, agent workflows, or automation around structured tools, this matters because correctness depends on respecting the product’s data model, not just generating plausible text. Obsidian is a strong case study for how product-specific agent interfaces can reduce silent corruption and improve reliability.
