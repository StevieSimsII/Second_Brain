## Overview

This lesson distills a practical set of advanced looping patterns that show up constantly in real engineering work, even when the original source does not provide detailed transcript content. Rather than treating loops as only `for` and `while` syntax, the focus here is on higher-value iteration strategies: nested traversal, sentinel-controlled loops, early exits, infinite event loops, accumulation, and pattern-based iteration over data structures.

Engineers care about these patterns because performance bugs, correctness issues, and readability problems often come from poorly structured iteration. If you already know basic loop syntax, this lesson helps you recognize which loop shape fits a given problem and how to implement it safely and maintainably.

## Key Concepts

- **Counter-controlled loops**: A counter-controlled loop runs a known number of times, usually over a numeric range or indexed collection. This is the most predictable loop form and is often the easiest to analyze for correctness and time complexity.
- **Sentinel-controlled loops**: A sentinel-controlled loop continues until a specific condition or marker is encountered, such as end-of-file, null input, or a special token. These loops are common in streaming, parsing, and interactive programs where the total amount of work is not known in advance.
- **Nested loops**: Nested loops iterate over combinations or multi-dimensional structures such as matrices, grids, and pairwise comparisons. They are powerful but can quickly become expensive, so engineers must understand the multiplicative cost of inner loops.
- **Early exit and loop pruning**: Using `break`, `continue`, and guard conditions can dramatically reduce unnecessary work. Pruning is especially useful in search, validation, and optimization tasks where you can stop as soon as a result is found or a constraint is violated.
- **Accumulator patterns**: An accumulator loop builds a result over time, such as a sum, frequency map, transformed list, or rolling state. This pattern underlies many reductions and is a foundation for efficient one-pass algorithms.
- **Infinite and event-driven loops**: Some systems intentionally run forever until externally stopped, such as servers, game loops, and message consumers. The engineering challenge is not syntax but ensuring safe termination paths, backoff behavior, and resource management.

## How It Works

Looping is less about syntax and more about selecting the correct control-flow pattern for the problem.

A useful way to think about loops is to classify them by what determines termination:

1. **Fixed work**: you know exactly how many iterations are needed.
2. **Data-driven work**: you continue until input is exhausted.
3. **State-driven work**: you continue until the system reaches a valid or stable state.
4. **Open-ended work**: you continue indefinitely while reacting to events.

### 1. Fixed iteration: the baseline pattern
Use a counter-controlled loop when traversing arrays, generating ranges, or repeatedly applying a procedure a known number of times.

```python
for i in range(len(items)):
    process(items[i])
```

This pattern is easy to reason about, but direct indexing is not always the best choice. If you do not need the index, iterate over values instead. If you need both, prefer an explicit mechanism like `enumerate()` in Python or iterator APIs in other languages.

### 2. Data-driven iteration: read until the stream ends
When processing files, network messages, or user input, the number of loop iterations is unknown beforehand. In those cases, the loop should be controlled by the availability of data rather than a numeric counter.

```python
while True:
    line = stream.readline()
    if not line:
        break
    handle(line)
```

This is safer than guessing how much input exists. The core engineering concern is making the termination condition explicit and ensuring malformed input does not trap the program in an unintended infinite loop.

### 3. Nested loops: combining dimensions of work
Nested loops appear whenever you compare each item with many others, traverse 2D structures, or generate combinations.

```python
for row in grid:
    for cell in row:
        inspect(cell)
```

The important detail is complexity. If the outer loop runs `n` times and the inner loop runs `m` times, the total work is typically `O(n*m)`. In square pairwise comparisons, that often becomes `O(n^2)`. Engineers should ask whether the nested traversal is truly necessary or whether indexing, hashing, sorting, or precomputation can reduce the cost.

### 4. Early exit: avoid wasted iterations
A loop should stop as soon as it has enough information to produce the answer.

```python
def contains_negative(nums):
    for n in nums:
        if n < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This is better than scanning the entire list after the answer is already known. Similarly, `continue` can skip irrelevant cases early and keep the main body focused on meaningful work.

### 5. Accumulator loops: one-pass state updates
Many production tasks can be solved with a single pass over the data by carrying forward a small amount of state.

```python
counts = {}
for word in words:
    counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1
```

This pattern is common in metrics, logs, ETL pipelines, compilers, and analytics jobs. The engineering advantage is both performance and clarity: one well-structured pass is usually easier to test than several loosely connected passes.

### 6. Infinite loops: deliberate, not accidental
Infinite loops are valid in systems that continuously react to work.

```python
while True:
    event = queue.get()
    handle(event)
```

What makes this pattern robust is everything around it: timeout handling, signal-based shutdown, exception recovery, backpressure, and observability. In real systems, an infinite loop should almost always include a clear operational exit strategy.

### 7. Choosing the right loop pattern
A practical decision framework:

- If the work count is known: use a counter-controlled loop.
- If input availability controls progress: use a sentinel/data-driven loop.
- If traversing combinations or dimensions: use nested loops, but check complexity.
- If the result may be found early: add `break` or `return`.
- If aggregating a result: use an accumulator.
- If building a service or consumer: use an intentional event loop with safe shutdown.

The biggest mistakes engineers make with loops are:

- hiding termination conditions
- mutating loop state in too many places
- using nested loops without considering complexity
- failing to short-circuit when the answer is already known
- writing open-ended loops without operational safeguards

The best loops are boring in the best way: easy to read, easy to terminate mentally, and obviously correct.

## Training Exercise

Practice the loop patterns by implementing a small command-line log analyzer.

### Goal
Write a program that reads lines from a file and reports:

1. total number of lines
2. number of lines containing `ERROR`
3. whether any line contains `FATAL`
4. the first line number where `FATAL` appears

### Step-by-step
1. Create a file named `sample.log` with contents like:

```text
INFO service started
WARN retrying request
ERROR failed to connect
INFO fallback enabled
FATAL unrecoverable state
INFO shutdown
```

2. Write a program that uses a **sentinel/data-driven loop** to read the file line by line.
3. Use **accumulators** for `total_lines` and `error_count`.
4. Use an **early exit decision** for detecting the first `FATAL`, but keep scanning if your exercise requires full statistics. Then try a second version that exits immediately when `FATAL` is found.
5. Print the final report.
6. Refactor the program to compare the tradeoff between:
   - scanning the entire file
   - stopping early after `FATAL`

### Example in Python

```python
total_lines = 0
error_count = 0
fatal_found = False
fatal_line = None

with open("sample.log", "r") as f:
    for line_no, line in enumerate(f, start=1):
        total_lines += 1

        if "ERROR" in line:
            error_count += 1

        if not fatal_found and "FATAL" in line:
            fatal_found = True
            fatal_line = line_no

print({
    "total_lines": total_lines,
    "error_count": error_count,
    "fatal_found": fatal_found,
    "fatal_line": fatal_line,
})
```

### Stretch tasks
- Implement the same logic with a `while True` loop and explicit `readline()` termination.
- Add nested loops by analyzing multiple log files in a directory.
- Measure runtime on a large generated file and compare full-scan vs early-exit behavior.
- Reimplement in your primary language and identify the language-specific iteration idioms.
