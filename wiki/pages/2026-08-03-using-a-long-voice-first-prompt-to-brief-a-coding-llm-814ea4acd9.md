## Overview

This lesson teaches a practical prompting pattern from the source: give a coding LLM a long, messy, spoken brief instead of over-editing a short typed prompt. The claimed benefit is better context gathering up front, which reduces later corrections. The source demonstrates this with a website request for a naturopath audience, but it is a transcript of a video demo, not formal product documentation, so interface details and capability claims should be treated as reported by the speaker rather than independently verified facts.

## Key Concepts

- **Ramble session**: Start with a long, stream-of-consciousness description of the project. The source argues that modern LLMs can reconstruct messy intent surprisingly well and return a cleaner version of the user's thinking.
- **Voice over typing**: The source recommends speaking when you have many partially formed ideas. This lowers friction, captures more context, and avoids spending effort on wording before the model understands the task.
- **Goal framing**: Even in a messy brief, the model works better when the desired outcome is explicit. The source mentions a specific goal command and also recommends restating the goal in one line at the end.
- **Useful briefing dimensions**: The source lists several dimensions to mention: desire, quality bar, tools available, discovery, creative freedom, verification loop, and delivery format. These act like a checklist for richer project context.
- **Plan mode vs. execution mode**: If you want control before any building happens, ask for a plan first. The source says plan mode lets the human review the approach before the model starts implementation.
- **Verification loop**: A strong prompt should say how the model checks its own work. In the example, the speaker claims the system researched the audience, generated assets, and checked mobile optimization before finishing.

## How It Works

Use this pattern when you know the outcome you want better than the exact instructions. First, describe the project in plain language for several minutes, including uncertainties. Second, give the model enough structure to act: what you want, what good looks like, what tools it may use, how much autonomy it has, how it should verify quality, and what final artifact to produce. Third, restate the goal clearly in one sentence. If you want a checkpoint, ask for a plan before execution.

A reusable template based on the source is:
"I want to build [outcome]. I am not fully sure about [uncertainties]. Research the audience, language, design direction, and any missing domain context. Aim for [quality bar]. Use any available tools, repositories, internet research, or existing skills as needed. Make reasonable creative decisions on your own. Verify the result by checking [criteria]. Deliver it as [format] in [location]. Final goal: [single-sentence goal]."

In the source's example, the user asks for a beautiful naturopath website without knowing the domain well. The model is instructed to research the audience, choose visuals and copy, decide on a CTA, and produce a local HTML site. The transcript claims the result included audience-specific copy, generated images, pricing research, and mobile checks. Because this is a narrated demo, treat those outputs as claims about what happened in that session, not guaranteed behavior in every run.

## Training Exercise

Exercise: brief a coding LLM to create a one-page site for a niche service you do not know well.

1. Pick a domain such as "sleep coach," "estate planner," or "dog behavior consultant."
2. Speak or write a 5-10 minute ramble covering: what you think the service might be, who the audience could be, what action you want visitors to take, what style might fit, and what you are unsure about.
3. Convert the ramble into a structured brief with these headings: desire, quality bar, tools/discovery, creative freedom, verification loop, delivery, final goal.
4. Ask the model for a plan first. Review whether the plan fills in your missing domain knowledge instead of guessing blindly.
5. Then allow execution and compare the final result against your original ramble.

Success criteria: the final brief is clearer than your raw notes, the model identifies missing information instead of hiding uncertainty, and the deliverable matches the stated goal and verification criteria.
