## Overview

This lesson explains how to think about a long-running AI coding agent experiment, where a model like Codex is allowed to operate for hours with minimal interruption. Even when the source material is only a video title, the scenario is highly relevant to engineers evaluating whether agentic coding tools can move beyond autocomplete and handle multi-step software work.

Working engineers care about this because the real question is not whether an AI can write a function, but whether it can sustain progress across planning, code changes, test execution, debugging, and recovery from mistakes. This lesson focuses on the practical framework for assessing such experiments: what to measure, where agent workflows break down, and how to build safe, reproducible evaluation loops inside a development environment.

## Key Concepts

- **Long-running coding agent**: A long-running coding agent is an AI system that performs a sequence of development tasks over an extended session rather than answering a single prompt. It typically plans work, edits files, runs commands, inspects outputs, and iterates toward a goal such as implementing a feature or fixing bugs.
- **Agent loop**: The agent loop is the repeated cycle of observe, decide, act, and verify. In software tasks, this usually means reading the codebase, choosing a change, editing files, running tests or builds, and using the results to decide the next action.
- **Autonomy vs supervision**: Autonomy determines how much freedom the agent has to choose actions without human input, while supervision defines the guardrails around those actions. More autonomy can increase throughput, but it also increases the chance of wasted work, incorrect assumptions, or destructive changes.
- **Evaluation criteria**: Useful evaluation goes beyond whether the agent produced code. Engineers should measure task completion, correctness, test pass rate, number of iterations, time spent stuck, rollback frequency, and the amount of human intervention required.
- **Failure modes**: Agentic coding systems commonly fail by misunderstanding requirements, making plausible but incorrect edits, repeatedly retrying ineffective fixes, or drifting away from the task. Identifying these patterns is essential if you want to decide where agents are trustworthy and where they still need tight control.
- **Operational safety**: Safety in this context means constraining the environment so the agent cannot damage production systems, leak secrets, or perform irreversible actions. Sandboxed repos, ephemeral environments, scoped credentials, and explicit approval gates are standard protections.

## How It Works

A long-running AI coding experiment usually starts with a bounded objective: implement a feature, fix a bug, refactor a subsystem, or improve tests. The interesting part is not the initial prompt but the sustained execution. Over several hours, the agent must maintain context, choose what to inspect, modify code coherently, and recover when its first approach fails.

At a mechanical level, the workflow often looks like this:

1. **Initial task intake**
   - The agent receives a goal and possibly constraints.
   - It inspects the repository structure, relevant files, and existing tests.
   - It forms an implicit or explicit plan.

2. **Action phase**
   - It edits source files.
   - It may add tests, adjust configuration, or update documentation.
   - It executes local commands such as builds, linters, or test suites.

3. **Feedback phase**
   - The agent parses compiler errors, test failures, stack traces, and command output.
   - It decides whether to refine the current approach, revert, or try a different strategy.

4. **Iteration**
   - This loop can repeat dozens or hundreds of times in a long session.
   - The agent's quality depends heavily on whether each cycle reduces uncertainty or just creates more churn.

What engineers should pay attention to in a six-hour run is the **shape of progress**. A good run usually shows these traits:

- The agent narrows the problem over time.
- Changes become more targeted rather than more scattered.
- Test coverage or validation improves as implementation evolves.
- The agent uses tool outputs to make better decisions.

A weak run often looks different:

- Repeated edits to the same files without convergence.
- Superficial fixes that silence one error and create two more.
- Excessive command retries with no new information.
- Hallucinated assumptions about APIs, file names, or architecture.

Because the source is a video title rather than a transcript, the best technical takeaway is the evaluation framework itself. When someone says, "I let Codex run for 6 hours," the important engineering question is not the novelty of the duration. It is whether the agent demonstrated reliable multi-step problem solving under realistic development conditions.

A practical evaluation should include:

- **Task definition**: Was the goal clear and objectively testable?
- **Environment setup**: Did the agent work in a clean repo, container, or sandbox?
- **Tool access**: Could it run tests, inspect logs, and search code?
- **Intervention log**: How often did a human redirect it?
- **Outcome quality**: Did the final result actually solve the problem?
- **Cost profile**: How much time, compute, and supervision were required?

If you are comparing agentic coding tools, structure the benchmark so each system gets the same repository snapshot, prompt, permissions, and test harness. Otherwise, you are mostly measuring setup differences and operator behavior instead of the model's real coding ability.

In production engineering teams, the strongest use cases for long-running agents today tend to be:

- Writing or extending tests
- Performing repetitive refactors
- Scaffolding well-understood features
- Investigating failures and summarizing likely root causes
- Preparing draft pull requests for human review

The weakest use cases are usually tasks with ambiguous requirements, hidden business rules, poor test coverage, or cross-system side effects. In those cases, the agent can appear productive for hours while making very little real progress.

## Training Exercise

Run your own controlled mini-experiment to evaluate an AI coding agent over a 60-90 minute session.

### Goal
Measure whether an agent can complete a small but realistic software task with limited supervision.

### Setup
1. Choose a small repository you understand well.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Define one task with a clear success criterion, for example:
   - add input validation to an API handler
   - fix a reproducible bug
   - add tests for an existing utility module
4. Prepare a validation command such as:

```bash
npm test
# or
pytest -q
# or
go test ./...
```

### Step-by-step
1. **Write the task brief**
   Include:
   - objective
   - files or modules likely involved
   - constraints
   - exact definition of done

2. **Set guardrails**
   - no production credentials
   - no network access if not needed
   - no force-push or destructive git commands
   - require human approval before dependency upgrades

3. **Start the session**
   Let the agent inspect the codebase, propose a plan, and begin making changes.

4. **Log every intervention**
   Create a file named `agent-eval.md` and record:
   - timestamp
   - what the agent attempted
   - whether it learned from failures
   - when you had to redirect it

5. **Score the result**
   At the end, rate the run from 1-5 on:
   - correctness
   - efficiency
   - code quality
   - test quality
   - autonomy

6. **Perform a postmortem**
   Answer these questions:
   - Where did the agent lose time?
   - Did it use test output effectively?
   - Were failures due to model reasoning, missing context, or poor environment setup?
   - Would you trust it on a similar task again?

### Optional scoring template
Use this simple markdown table:

```md
| Metric            | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| Task completion   |             |       |
| Correctness       |             |       |
| Test pass rate    |             |       |
| Human intervention|             |       |
| Code quality      |             |       |
| Time to converge  |             |       |
```

### Stretch exercise
Repeat the same task twice:
- once with a short, tightly scoped prompt
- once with a broader autonomous instruction set

Compare which setup leads to better convergence. This will teach you whether your bottleneck is model capability or task framing.
