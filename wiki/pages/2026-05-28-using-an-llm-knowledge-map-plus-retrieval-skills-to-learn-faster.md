## Overview

This lesson is about a practical pattern for accelerating technical learning: combine a structured LLM-oriented knowledge map or wiki with the skill of retrieval and targeted questioning. Even though the source content is sparse, the title suggests a workflow where a curated map of large-language-model concepts becomes much more valuable when paired with the ability to search, connect, validate, and operationalize what you find.

This matters to engineers because modern AI systems are too broad to keep entirely in working memory. A well-organized wiki helps you navigate the space, but the real leverage comes from knowing how to retrieve the right concept, ask precise follow-up questions, and turn references into working understanding. This lesson is aimed at engineers who want a repeatable system for learning LLMs efficiently rather than passively consuming content.

## Key Concepts

- **Knowledge map**: A knowledge map is a structured index of concepts, tools, and relationships in a domain. For LLMs, it might connect topics like tokenization, transformers, pretraining, fine-tuning, evaluation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Its main value is reducing search cost and giving learners a mental framework.
- **Retrieval skill**: Retrieval skill is the ability to find the right information quickly, using targeted search, references, embeddings, or curated notes. In practice, this means knowing how to move from a vague question to a specific source, then from that source to the next relevant concept. This skill turns static reference material into an active learning tool.
- **Progressive depth**: Progressive depth means starting with a high-level explanation and drilling down only when needed. For LLM topics, this avoids getting lost in mathematical or systems-level details too early. Engineers can use this approach to maintain momentum while still building rigorous understanding over time.
- **Question decomposition**: Question decomposition is the process of breaking a broad topic into smaller, answerable technical questions. Instead of asking 'How do LLMs work?', you ask about attention, context windows, training objectives, inference latency, and retrieval integration separately. This improves both learning speed and answer quality.
- **Source triangulation**: Source triangulation means validating an idea using multiple perspectives, such as a wiki, official documentation, papers, and code examples. This is especially important in AI, where simplified explanations often omit practical constraints. Engineers use triangulation to separate intuition-building summaries from implementation truth.
- **Learning-by-building**: Learning-by-building means turning concepts into small experiments, scripts, or prototypes. For LLMs, even a minimal retrieval pipeline or prompt-evaluation harness can reveal gaps in understanding much faster than passive reading. The goal is to force operational clarity.

## How It Works

The central idea is to treat a domain wiki or concept map as the navigation layer for your learning, not the final authority. In LLM work, the space is large and interconnected: model architecture, training data, alignment, inference, evaluation, tool use, vector databases, and deployment all influence one another. A wiki helps you see the terrain. The game-changing skill is knowing how to retrieve exactly what you need from that terrain and turn it into action.

A practical workflow looks like this:

1. **Start from a concrete task**
   - Example: 'I want to understand why retrieval-augmented generation helps reduce hallucinations.'
   - This anchors your exploration in an engineering problem, not a vague study goal.

2. **Use the wiki or map to identify the relevant concept cluster**
   - You might branch into: embeddings, chunking, vector search, context injection, grounding, and evaluation.
   - This prevents you from reading unrelated material and keeps the learning path coherent.

3. **Decompose the topic into retrieval-friendly questions**
   - What is retrieval-augmented generation?
   - How are documents chunked?
   - How are embeddings generated and compared?
   - What failure modes occur when irrelevant chunks are retrieved?
   - How do you evaluate whether retrieval improved answer quality?

4. **Retrieve multiple forms of evidence**
   - Concept explanation from a wiki or structured note set.
   - Official docs for a library or API.
   - A paper or technical blog post.
   - A small runnable example.

5. **Build a tiny implementation or test harness**
   - This is where understanding becomes durable.
   - If you cannot implement even a small version, you likely do not understand the concept yet.

The important mechanism here is that the wiki reduces discovery cost, while retrieval skill reduces ambiguity. A static knowledge base tells you what exists; retrieval tells you what matters now. Engineers who combine both tend to learn faster because they avoid two common traps: reading linearly through too much material, and relying on a single oversimplified explanation.

Another way to think about it is as a feedback loop:

- **Map** the domain
- **Retrieve** the relevant concept
- **Test** it in a small artifact
- **Refine** your understanding
- **Update** your notes or personal wiki

This loop compounds over time. Your notes become more than bookmarks; they become a personalized technical graph of concepts, examples, and failure cases.

For LLM-specific learning, a useful structure is to organize your knowledge base into layers:

- **Foundation**: tokenization, transformers, attention, next-token prediction
- **Training**: pretraining, fine-tuning, RLHF/DPO, data curation
- **Inference**: prompting, decoding, latency, quantization, batching
- **Augmentation**: retrieval, tools, agents, memory
- **Evaluation**: benchmarks, task metrics, hallucination analysis, human evals
- **Deployment**: serving, cost, observability, safety, caching

With this structure, retrieval becomes easier because every new question has a likely home. If the question is 'Why does my assistant ignore retrieved context?', you know to inspect augmentation and inference layers, not just prompting. If the question is 'Why did answer quality regress after changing chunk size?', you know to retrieve material on embeddings, retrieval recall, and context packing.

A practical engineer-friendly method is to store notes in Markdown and use links between concepts. For example:

```text
rag.md
  -> embeddings.md
  -> chunking.md
  -> vector-search.md
  -> evaluation.md
```

Then every note should contain:
- a one-paragraph definition
- 2-3 failure modes
- one code example
- links to deeper references

This keeps the wiki actionable instead of encyclopedic.

Finally, the skill that makes the whole system work is asking better questions. Good retrieval depends on precise queries. Compare:

- Weak: 'Teach me LLMs'
- Better: 'Explain how embedding chunk size affects retrieval recall and downstream answer grounding in a RAG pipeline'

The second question is scoped, testable, and connected to implementation choices. That is the level of specificity that turns a knowledge map into a real engineering advantage.

## Training Exercise

Build a mini personal LLM wiki and use it to answer one technical question through retrieval.

### Goal
Create a small, structured knowledge base for one LLM topic, then use it to investigate a practical engineering question.

### Step 1: Pick a topic cluster
Choose one of the following:
- Retrieval-augmented generation
- Prompt engineering and evaluation
- Fine-tuning vs in-context learning
- Embeddings and semantic search

### Step 2: Create 4 linked notes
Create a folder and add four Markdown files. Example for RAG:

```bash
mkdir llm-wiki
cd llm-wiki
touch rag.md embeddings.md chunking.md evaluation.md
```

Populate each file with:
- a short definition
- 2 implementation considerations
- 2 failure modes
- 2 links to related notes

Example starter content for `rag.md`:

```md
# Retrieval-Augmented Generation
RAG augments a language model by retrieving relevant external documents and injecting them into the model context before generation.

## Implementation considerations
- Chunk size affects retrieval quality and context efficiency.
- Embedding model choice influences semantic matching.

## Failure modes
- Retrieved passages are irrelevant or redundant.
- Useful context is retrieved but ignored by the generator.

## Related
- [[embeddings]]
- [[chunking]]
- [[evaluation]]
```

### Step 3: Write one concrete question
Example:
- How does chunk size affect a RAG system's answer quality?

### Step 4: Retrieve from your notes first
Without searching broadly, answer the question using only your four notes. Write down what is still unclear.

### Step 5: Triangulate with external sources
Find:
- one official documentation page
- one technical blog or paper
- one code example or notebook

Update your notes with anything you missed.

### Step 6: Produce an engineering summary
Write a 1-page summary with these sections:
- What I thought initially
- What retrieval from my wiki told me
- What external sources corrected or added
- What implementation decision I would make now

### Step 7: Optional coding extension
If you want a lightweight prototype, simulate a retrieval pipeline in Python by storing chunks and ranking them with a simple keyword overlap heuristic:

```python
docs = [
    "Small chunks improve precision but may lose context.",
    "Large chunks preserve context but can reduce retrieval specificity.",
    "Evaluation should measure both retrieval relevance and answer quality."
]
query = "How does chunk size affect retrieval quality?"

scores = []
q_terms = set(query.lower().split())
for doc in docs:
    d_terms = set(doc.lower().split())
    score = len(q_terms & d_terms)
    scores.append((score, doc))

for score, doc in sorted(scores, reverse=True):
    print(score, doc)
```

### Success criteria
You should end the exercise with:
- a small linked wiki
- one answered technical question
- at least three validated external references
- one implementation takeaway you could apply in a real project
