## Overview
These notes explain how hooks work in AI-assisted developer tools like GitHub Copilot CLI and VS Code integrations. Hooks act as programmable interception points before or after AI-driven actions, giving you a way to inspect, modify, allow, or deny operations such as file writes, shell commands, and other tool calls.

The main value of hooks is control. Rather than relying on prompts alone, hooks provide an enforceable policy layer for safety, code quality, and workflow consistency. This makes them especially useful for blocking risky commands, enforcing lint or formatting rules, and adding observability to AI-assisted coding workflows.

## Key Concepts
- **Hooks**: Programmable interception points around events in a tool workflow. In AI-assisted development, they let you run custom logic before or after a tool call so the AI's actions can be governed instead of blindly trusted.
- **PreToolUse**: A hook that runs before an AI agent invokes a tool or command. It is especially useful for enforcing policy before execution happens.
- **Tool call denial**: Hooks can reject tool invocations that violate rules. This creates fail-closed behavior rather than depending on the model to follow warnings.
- **Workflow guardrails**: Hooks are a practical mechanism for implementing guardrails around AI behavior, helping align tool use with security, quality, and team standards.
- **Lint and quality enforcement**: Hooks can require formatting, lint, or test conditions before a write or execution step is allowed.
- **Debugging and observability**: Since hooks sit in the decision path, they are a good place to log requested actions, policy checks, and allow/deny outcomes.

## How It Works
At a high level, hooks wrap AI-initiated actions. When the model decides it wants to do something—edit a file, run a shell command, or call a tool—the platform emits a hook event. A hook such as `PreToolUse` can inspect the request and return a decision to allow, modify, or deny the action.

A typical flow looks like this:

1. The model plans an action.
2. The platform emits a hook event.
3. Hook logic evaluates the request against policy.
4. The action is executed or blocked.
5. Optional post-action hooks record results or trigger follow-up steps.

This matters because LLMs are not reliable policy engines. Prompt instructions like “always lint before writing code” are soft constraints. Hooks move those rules into code, where they become enforceable. That makes them more like middleware, admission control, or policy enforcement than simple customization.

A common `PreToolUse` pattern is protecting file writes and shell commands. Policies can require that:
- paths stay within an approved workspace
- commands come from an allowlist
- code passes lint or formatting checks
- dangerous operations require manual approval

Example pseudocode from the notes shows the pattern clearly:

```js
function preToolUse(event) {
  const { toolName, args, targetFiles } = event;

  if (toolName === 'writeFile' && targetFiles.some(f => f.endsWith('.js'))) {
    const lintOk = runLintCheck(targetFiles);
    if (!lintOk) {
      return { allow: false, reason: 'Refusing file write because lint rules fail.' };
    }
  }

  if (toolName === 'runCommand' && args.command.includes('rm -rf')) {
    return { allow: false, reason: 'Dangerous command blocked by policy.' };
  }

  return { allow: true };
}
```

This approach shifts AI tooling from “best effort” compliance to hard constraints. Instead of asking the model to behave, you define conditions that must be true before the system proceeds.

Observability is also important. Good hook debugging usually logs:
- event type
- requested tool
- relevant arguments or file paths
- checks performed
- final decision
- any error output

That visibility helps separate different classes of problems: unsafe model requests, overly strict policy logic, or downstream tool failures. In practice, hooks are best treated as a governance layer for AI-assisted development, not just a convenience feature.

Overview

This lesson explains the idea of hooks in AI-assisted developer tools such as GitHub Copilot CLI and Visual Studio Code integrations. Hooks are interception points that run before or after an AI tool action, letting you inspect, modify, allow, or block behavior. For engineers using AI in coding workflows, they provide a practical control layer between a model's intent and actual execution.

The main reason hooks matter is reliability and governance. AI coding tools can generate code that compiles poorly, ignores lint rules, or invokes commands you would rather restrict. A hook like PreToolUse can enforce guardrails before the tool runs, making hooks one of the most valuable mechanisms for improving safety, code quality, and workflow consistency in day-to-day engineering.

Key Concepts

  *   Hooks: Hooks are programmable interception points around an event in a tool workflow. In AI-assisted development, they let you run custom logic when the assistant is about to call a tool, has finished a call, or is transitioning between stages. This turns the AI toolchain into something you can govern rather than passively accept.
  *   PreToolUse: PreToolUse is a hook that executes before an AI agent invokes a tool or command. Its most important capability is policy enforcement: you can deny execution unless certain conditions are met, such as lint compliance, path restrictions, or command allowlists. This is especially useful for preventing bad automation from touching your codebase.
  *   Tool call denial: A hook can reject a requested tool invocation when the request violates a rule. Denial is more powerful than warning because it makes the workflow fail closed instead of relying on the model to behave well after being told not to. In practice, this is how you enforce standards consistently.
  *   Workflow guardrails: Guardrails are rules and checks added around an AI system to reduce unsafe or low-quality actions. Hooks are an implementation mechanism for these guardrails because they can inspect context, apply policies, and block execution. This helps align AI output with engineering standards, security constraints, and team practices.
  *   Lint and quality enforcement: One concrete use case for hooks is requiring code quality checks before a write or execution step is allowed. Instead of trusting the model to remember formatting, linting, or test expectations, the hook enforces them automatically. This reduces churn from broken code and keeps AI-generated changes closer to production-ready.
  *   Debugging and observability: Because hooks sit in the control path, they are also a natural place to log requests, decisions, and failures. Good hook debugging means capturing the requested action, relevant metadata, and the reason for allowing or denying it. Without observability, hooks become difficult to trust and maintain.

How It Works

At a high level, hooks wrap the execution of AI-driven actions. An AI agent decides it wants to perform some operation—such as editing a file, running a shell command, or calling an internal tool. Before that action happens, a hook like `PreToolUse` gets a chance to inspect the request. The hook can then return a decision: allow, modify, or deny.

This creates a simple but powerful control flow:

1. The model plans an action. 2. The platform emits a hook event. 3. Your hook code evaluates the event against policy. 4. The tool action is either executed or blocked. 5. Optional post-action hooks can log results or trigger follow-up behavior.

The reason this matters is that LLMs are probabilistic systems, not policy engines. Even when prompted to follow rules like "always lint before writing code," they may skip steps or proceed with partial compliance. Hooks move those rules out of the prompt and into enforceable automation.

A common pattern is using `PreToolUse` to protect file writes or command execution. For example, if the AI attempts to modify source files, the hook could require that:

- the target path is inside an approved workspace - the command is from an allowlist - generated code passes formatting or lint checks - certain high-risk operations, like deleting files or changing CI config, require manual approval

In practice, the decision logic often looks like a policy function over the requested tool call. Pseudocode:

```js function preToolUse(event) { const { toolName, args, targetFiles } = event;

if (toolName === 'writeFile' && targetFiles.some(f => f.endsWith('.js'))) { const lintOk = runLintCheck(targetFiles); if (!lintOk) { return { allow: false, reason: 'Refusing file write because lint rules fail.' }; } }

if (toolName === 'runCommand' && args.command.includes('rm -rf')) { return { allow: false, reason: 'Dangerous command blocked by policy.' }; }

return { allow: true }; } ```

This example captures the core idea from the source: deny the tool call unless the AI meets your
