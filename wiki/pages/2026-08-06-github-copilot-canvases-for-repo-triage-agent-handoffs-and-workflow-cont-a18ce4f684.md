## Overview

This lesson explains GitHub Copilot app canvases as demonstrated in the supplied video transcript. A canvas is presented as a generated, repo-aware interface that helps a developer inspect issues, PRs, releases, deployments, and actions, then take follow-up actions without leaving the Copilot app. The transcript gives strong anecdotal evidence for several workflows: issue triage with scoring, dashboard-style repo hubs, starting new agent sessions from UI actions, triggering GitHub Actions workflows, and importing community canvases. Because the source is a product demo transcript rather than formal documentation, treat the exact commands, scopes, and capabilities as demonstrated behavior, not guaranteed platform specification.

## Key Concepts

- **Canvas as a task-specific interface**: The speaker shows a canvas as a custom interface generated inside the GitHub Copilot app for a concrete job, such as issue triage or monitoring repository actions.
- **Prompt-to-tool generation**: A canvas can be created from a short request such as `/create canvas`, after which the agent builds the interface based on the repo context and requested workflow.
- **Local triage state and ranking**: In the issue-triage example, the user assigns values like urgency and effort, saves them locally, and uses those scores to stack-rank work.
- **Repo-aware dashboards**: The transcript describes hub-style canvases that surface open PRs, open issues, stale releases, failed deployments, and other signals for selected repositories.
- **Agent session handoff**: Canvas actions can launch new agent sessions for narrowly scoped work, such as refining a spec, planning implementation, or assigning work to a cloud session.
- **Operational control from the canvas**: The actions-focused example shows a canvas listing workflows, recent runs, and status details, and attempting to trigger workflows when the repo supports that path.
- **Importing and sharing canvases**: The speaker describes sharing canvases with a team or community and importing them from a Gister URL with user, project, or session scope.

## How It Works

Use this pattern when you want a reusable control surface for repetitive repository work. Start by defining one narrow task: triage issues, inspect workflows, review PRs, or prepare submissions. In the transcript, the speaker creates a canvas with a short prompt and lets the agent generate a working UI. The practical design principle is to ask for visible context plus a small set of actions. For issue triage, that means showing issue details, opening the issue on GitHub, assigning urgency and effort, saving scores, and optionally posting updates. For a repo hub, it means summarizing only the repositories you actively care about rather than everything you own. For agent collaboration, the canvas should expose actions that spin up focused sessions with explicit instructions like “refine the spec” instead of “implement code.” For workflow operations, the canvas can show recent runs and attempt execution, but the transcript also shows a limitation: one workflow could not be dispatched because it did not declare workflow dispatch. That is an important lesson in designing durable agent tooling: the canvas can organize and initiate work, but repository capabilities still constrain what actions succeed. Finally, canvases are shown as shareable and importable, which makes them useful as personal workflow assets or team-standard operating surfaces.

## Training Exercise

Design a canvas prompt for your own repository. Keep it limited to one job: issue triage, PR review prep, or workflow monitoring. Specify 1) the data to show, 2) the actions to expose, 3) any scoring or prioritization rules, and 4) what should happen when the user clicks an action. Then evaluate your design against the transcript: does it reduce context switching, create focused agent handoffs, and respect repo-level constraints such as whether a workflow is dispatchable?
